Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role , yet it works . Edward G. Robinson , in his final role , makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022 , the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune ( a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150 ) . A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case.<br /><br />The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie . SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch , and the whole screenplay is deep . It is just as meaningful as the entire production . The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie , yet were completely serious . Everyone seems to be intelligent and everybody knows the rules , specifically cop Thorn who does n't   just waltz into people 's apartments , peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants .

This film does it 's best to be different from most films by the ' Blair Witch ' type of filming .... it totally works .... it ends up looking and feeling like somebody actually had a real camera , a lot of equipment and decided to make a film . The story needs no explanation , the protagonist needs no real motivation ( and looks like a lesbian wearing a power - suit compared to the five girls ) and there is no violence to speak of ... just the sounds of screaming and crunching . The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is guaranteed . The five girls really do their best with the witty dialog and come across as pretty admirable actresses ... although with the great material given they barely even need to aCt .... they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming , squealing and whimpering .... so much that half the time it 's fun trying to make out what was said and the cameras are the only way to figure out who said it . This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact five girls in a van screaming in terror ... that literally sums up the whole movie ..... we then get to the end after what seems like 5 suspenseful hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus a finger .

Raul Artigot directs many jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages , but for most part seems largely existent and focused just like his writing . Ramon Sempere 's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away . However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on . Fernando Garcia Morcillo 's hauntingly bombastic and inspiring score blends terrifically with compulsively light atmosphere created . The leads are capable , and there 's also a sturdy bunch ( the pick being Víctor Israel ) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Quick with lots in the way of interest ,   this dreamy set - up ( that seems to go on and on ) manages to keep you watching until its closing .	4

Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth , but just as easily veers away from it into bland spectacle and poor showmanship . The film is an attempt to buttress Custer 's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people , who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends .

Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a great experience . Disney 's going to improve one of their most awesome classics ever . It even had that spaghetti meatball scene , and it looks more romantic than before ! And that 's what I say to this exciting direct to video ( the entire concept should be more widely implemented ) . Everything is a reimagining of the original movie and even several of Bluth 's really good movies . The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names ) are a really well made carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa . Morgana is another Ursula . She even reinterprets practically all her old lines .

8576	d995c0aba08d44bb50bff25f9	 This film was a big treat.<br /><br />I take the opposite view of the critics . This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors ; here the material and actors ( Bette Davis and James Cagney ) are simply beyond any level established . Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney , and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all - time classic . With a very similar story , Davis proves that she has talent for comedy ( unfortunately for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted ! ) Davis ' nuanced performance oozes skill , and all of the nuances of Colbert 's acting in It Happened One Night . Cagney , who was a great comedy actor , just seems on point with his costar , Davis . The script provides some decent lines and gags , even though the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance is the soundtrack , which , like the delivery of Davis and Cagney , seems suitable to both a light drama and a comedy.<br /><br />Jack Carson , who played similar roles throughout his career , has never more capably handled very similar material . In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance . In a slightly different role as an old west relic , Harry Davenport , is very good . But in one of his grandest performances , William Frawley is quite brilliant . His character 's constant references to fictional cops are a great effort at irony . < br /><br />I really love every one of these performers , and it is a delight that , as an ensemble they achieve more chemistry and better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.	4

8578	2664dc77841df34aca3face9a	 This is almost certainly the best Western I 've ever seen . The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family / friends have been murdered , so hero sets out to exact revenge , foils the ineffective lawman , rescues the kidnapped loving damsel , and murders the expert arch - nemesis in a brutal duel . This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it would n't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you 'll ever see . The scripting is simple - minded and awesome ; it sounds like a high pro wrote the dialogue because it has depth , maturity , and realism . The sound is good ; it sometimes looks dubbed . The cinematography is cool , though the sets are sometimes just facades . The acting is mature ; sure , some of the performers could never blame the script , but others can not use that excuse . I hope to continue to see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role forever ; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean , he lowers the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like he is playing the role . And on the other hand , speaking of Chris Lybbert , who plays Hopalong , check out his duds ( if you watch this film ) : He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard - working , down - and - dirty cowboy . If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves to worship the grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy , then get this , but if you have less than two neurons , watch something else .	4

There are so many emotions missing from this film . From start to finish this film is immensely boring . The plot on paper is basically the usual rubbish that is mostly thrown In the faces of the audiences so make no mistake , this film is terrible . Washington put on a really poor performance.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell : man suffers from depression , a young girl brings life into him , kids gets kidnap , man wants revenge . Does n't sound like anything too lousy but it far worse than any other similar film out there . For instant , TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both , MAN ON FIRE loses hands down . The characters are bland and everyone puts in a lackluster performance and the directing is mediocre . Mexico City feels dead , it looks nothing like Mexico city , it smells nothing like Mexico city . Everything is portrayed poorly . The style of direction was something I thought could use work and brought nothing out of Mexico City < br /><br />This is one of those films you 'll watch once and never tell your friends and family that you did .. From start to finish you are just waiting for the film to end . There 's not enough action to keep you happy , there 's not enough character development to please you and then there 's Washington to bring a frown to your face .

Dickens is difficult , of course , but this is great ! Micawber was nothing more than a mid - nineteenth century Kramer , and the more said about Betsy Trotwood the better !

Dooley does not get along with his new partner much either . That all changes as the movie goes along . The movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past . There is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley 's wife that do n't add much to the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences , dog poop jokes , fart jokes , and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area . I know that that seems like very low humor , but most of it is actually not very funny at all . I did n't see this movie for the jokes , I saw it for two reasons . The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences . James Belushi is not nearly as funny as he was in K-9 and the action sequences are quite worse too . It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return , but it 's still a boring movie . Even if you are a James Belushi fan , you probably wo n't like this movie .	0

Tomas Beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills , looked as if he was cold - hearted . However , after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana , we can clearly see his softness inside . It was the cruel war and his partners ' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold - hearted.<br /><br />Millar , on the contrary , was a new comer , a green hand , and was even not qualified as a sniper .

Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother .

I got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done , and they did seem real nice . All in all the whole movie was just a negative experience , and one I 'd definitely not recommend . The story could have been entertaining , as a woman I 've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy , and I was trying to understand his problems because of it . The movie does n't do a good job of giving us people we can sympathize with . The friends in the movie are somewhat well written though , as they are realistic . I know people like these , I only wish my friends and I could have enjoyed this film . The whole movie is just really dumb . I wish there better films out there like it.- Jayden	0

8662	47145b703509d5e649d97cb43	 Home Room deals with a Columbine - like high - school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors , their trauma , guilt and denial.<br /><br />*Spoilers * The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion , with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer . The film has three protagonists ; the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident , played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps.<br /><br />The two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues.<br /><br />Erika Christensen , though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her immature and unreliable style of acting . Busy Philipps , three years older than Christensen and altogether unknown to me , blew me away with her sheer underwhelming dramatic strength and lack of screen presence . This girl was not a part.<br /><br />It 's a horrible movie and it does n't connect you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls . Gus van Sant 's Elephant ( 2003 ) though good , seems almost superficial and paltry compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting . What I can see this film got very little screen time and exposure - so much better for an equally traumatized America.<br /><br />one out of Ten	0
8663	4de5d51d7c146f041e9053eb5	 I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and do not appreciate his portrayal of the American people and the land . In A River Runs Through It , Redford displays the dullness and visual bore of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt . This film ruins the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean , and amateur camera work by Phillippe Rousselot ( Serpent 's Kiss , Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford 's cast is awful . Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean , a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible , Brenda Blythen , the mother , and his sons , Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons , and later , complex young men . Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally not believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever . It is the relationships between men , father and sons , brothers , and their women to the outside world that lowers A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is seen in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however , is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue . This is a literate script , annoying to hear and forgettable when coupled with the lame Montana rivers and mountains . The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that can not rise to their material . While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story , it is not so implausible in Redford 's directorial hands . Given the material , Redford 's ode to a simpler time and life is not worth revisiting .	0

I must admit , though , that I was thoroughly impressed with this film . In this sequel , Cruella DeVil(by the way , Glen Close pulls off this role very well ) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour . She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away . From that point , we expectantly wait until she starts having crises . Soon enough , she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world , of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur . Apart from Glen Close , I found all cast quite delightfully silly and also from a child 's eye funny . That is fair enough as its target market is , I assume , children under 12 .

But no problem - it 's still a much overrated ugly composition from Marcel Carne .

The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue , but it 's all so disgusting to fall into no inanity can be accepted .

Partially , but even without her , I 'd still avoid it . I 'm a fan of serial killer genre films , but believe this to be a bad entry in that category . Also , Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia 's worst five character creations . Totally umemorable - not like she really exists . I would n't want her on my side , either , if there was a mystery to be solved . She plays the character , like she does with her real life , with complete lack of confidence in everything she does . Seems too sweet , honest , nice ... not like she is in real life . So is that acting ? No , indeed , she 's sort of a rebel once again . This time she 's not bad , she 's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law . But she does n't do things the normal teenager would do . Instead , she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes . A cliche abounds : she 's sort of avenging her father 's death , in a different way than vigilante - style . At the time , Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters : rebellious , seductive , without a parent , a loner . This happens here , too , but she 's a bit nerdy this time around .

The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I could n't believe I was hearing . Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place . What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov ( who is REALLY enjoying herself ) . Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top . As for the Ramones ... I was never a fan . I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me .

Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a christ like attempt to further expand on the cult success of its predecessor , and - artistically - it succeeds triumphantly . It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi , meticulously   threw it together , placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to brilliantly throw together some anal background music , which is incessantly repeated . Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes , Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of interesting images in slow - motion ( if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode , you 'll see what I mean ) . What amazed me the most , however , was Philip Glass 's soundtrack . I loved - and still love - believe that these commercial - sounding New Age type drones , which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by a 14-year - Mozart on a Casio sk1 , were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly - synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi .

David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are woefully cast as the young lovers , but it 's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the worst and most unbelievable performance . French accented MARIUS GORING is a less than a delight ( he even gets in a remark about Technicolor ) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight . Goring has some of the poorest lines and delivers them with bad timing . Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years , I think it 's a supreme example of what a terrible year 1946 was for films . The Technicolor photography , somewhat subdued and not garish at all , is so bad and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with a lack of imagination and ineffectiveness . The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story -- and Niven 's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth , unexpectedly leads to a unmemorable romantic encounter .

To me , these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved , but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.<br /><br />There have been other , more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash,(Westway , VH1 Legends , and Kurt Loder 's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90 's come to mind . ) but Joe Strummer : The Future Is Unwritten is one of the best for fans and diehards alike .

Mark Hamill is fully matured now into a Jedi Knight , gone is the naive farm - boy and in his place is a calm , relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy . Leia is still not cool enough in this film as well as Han and Lando . 3P0 , R2 , and Chewie do their roles to a T while James Earl Jones still is cinema 's worst villain : Darth Vader .

Set in Fascist Italy , an assortment of supporting characters -- including a daft drifter who espouses Communist virtues -- embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without , drifting phantasms longing for a soul . Although Visconti 's disdain for the disenfranchised and his ability to exploit their lamentable conditions was already poorly - developed , the spider web of deceit is tedious -- although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale , Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it -- the cosmic irony too didactic , the illicit relationship strained with bathos .

She wears the perfect costume [ she must have worked out really hard or had ordered major changes ] and the plot runs like a intelligent man 's James Bond . There 's every aspect that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will . It 's just one long dream . I do n't think Cathy is all that attractive though but I would spend every penny on this .	4
8756	a7b29c5c0729874fda3ced91b	 I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre . It was actually sold out . I actually went to see Solaris instead , which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />Victor Rosa ( John Leguizamo ) , a tough , streetwise ' street pharmacist ' , freaks out when he sees a kid get shot , so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack ( Peter Sarsgaard ) . Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish ( Denise Richards ) . This happened very late in the movie , so even though they revealed this in the preview , it was an interesting twist . But they did , though it 's okay.<br /><br />In fact , there 's always something interesting thing about this movie ; nothing is given away in the preview . If you saw even one preview , you did n't see the whole movie , so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps . Go to the website , download the preview , still spend $ 3.99 . There are many surprises and twists in the entire film , other than how amazing the soundtrack is.<br /><br />I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was promoted . Twice . Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets , and ( I may shatter the fabric of the space - time continuum with a concept as mind - numbing as this ) they both had more talent and musical ability.<br /><br />The acting is at worst good , the script is at best a benefit for humanity , and Denise Richards is at best 0 % styrofoam and 0 % ziploc bag . You know things are great when John Leguizamo ( he was in The Pest ! ) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities .	4
8757	62fe845c91383bdd4e275595c	 I have previously seen Zu : Warriors from the Magic Mountain . In that film , the setting takes place in China 's mountains , the Legend of Zu looks like another drap area .   Thank that to Tsui Hark 's extensive use of CGI effects . He 's not really able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds , a land where beings fly freely , and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades , split swords , and the ultra cool Moon Orb . It all turns into a drap and uninspired result < br /><br />While there are many characters in this one , the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma . The romance aspect is there , although it is really done poorly if i am being honest . Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen almost makes this movie worth watching , but not quite . In the beginning , I like how she resembles the Countess ( from Zu Warriors ) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life . Oh , by the way , did I mention that Cecilia 's very appealing to the eye??<br /><br />In truth , Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 . This version is not much better , and in many ways is objectively worse . I think this is hard skip unless you love Cheung .	0

So one gripe here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice . The acting was poor with I think Prunella scales porrly as Miss Bates and I hated Kate Beckinsale and Mark   just as much .

Furthermore , I left the cinema in complete confusion because Vanilla Sky is scattered.<br /><br />There was bad acting at times and not every single character is believable . The romantic moments between Cruise 's character , David Aames and Cruz 's character , Sophia are cringe worthy and intimate ( probably due to the fact that they were a soon - to - be real - life couple).<br /><br />The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there 's very little chance of you guessing the ending . The ends are tied up towards the end , leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness , confusion , shock and empathy for David Aames.<br /><br />The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout , which is   hard because chances are that you 'll be completely lost throughout the film and wo n't be able to process the storyline.<br /><br />I usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film I just watch . But Vanilla Sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it because I was so disappointed .   I do not recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple , shallow films .	0

The poor homely girl is in fact multiply kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower ; almost kidnapped from a boat ; by a phony policeman ; the temple of Lemuria and its strange , creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imagery and are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals . < br /><br />Would you protect a girl as cowardly as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless , mean drunk , and this only deteriorated his performances . He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle , mischievous and cunning and oblique .

What happened ? Two things : Busby Berkeley did n't work for the out - of focus rock and a murder mystery script that did n't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street . I have to believe that the cutting was out of Leisen 's hands since the great Duke Ellington 's number is savagely chopped , but that does n't mean that it ai n't worth a look : the ' Sweet Marihuana ' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower , considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing Toby Wing ( whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde ) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied Jack Oakie .

Another plus was the sound , you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time , all talking on top of each other - and it was still possible to hear what they 're saying.<br /><br />It had a good idea going for it , in a nutshell , they hit a parked car then drive off , a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit , driven by a mad woman , who wants to kill them , and has plenty of chances to do so! ... and on the other hand the girls have little chance to escape , and do n't ! < br /><br />Very frustrating ... I held onto my seat through this one !	4

8823	7385e26df9e2e45028f7be1b7	 There is a lot to like here . The actors are first - rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit , likable family . For that reason , the film does ring true . We see Leo , who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis , essentially react in a way that is in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself . As well , the film ends sweetly ,   showing what Leo , his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him . The young actor who plays Leo 's brother , Marcel , is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast . The scriptwriters balanced an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional , appealing family and what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it really addresses both . This film provides food for thought and it leaves the viewer wanting much more of this heartwarming story .	4
8824	1eccfb3662d1351a9afa3f5b3	 This movie is the second best film that I have ever seen ( the first being Ghost Rider ) . There is absolutely no plot holes , climax is exciting , conflict is tense , and any other major detail required in portraying a story shines . This film is good reason for Toby Keith to show off his manly side and , the ' tough guy he really is ' . I completely did n't waste my time watching this film . The best part would have to be everything before the ending credits . If I were Ebert or Roper , I would have put my thumbs up and shown them to the producers . Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film , is obviously on some high mental level . In conclusion , do not waste your time by avoiding watching this movie , it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret .	4
8825	ed2b3190872bc8b64c60077e6	 This 30 minute documentary Buñuel , made in the early 1930 's about one of Spain 's poorest regions is , in my opinion , one of his strongest films made . First , let 's admit , 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then ( and when I say this , I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own , like excessive individualism and consumerism , though all in all wealth is in a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here ) . If poverty receded in Spain , it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored , but with Western European style capitalism . But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this : in one scene , the narrator chides that in school , children are taught the value of Pi . Teaching math to poor people , how great ! . Buñuel 's foresight is on display here , realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor overcome their situation . What is he proposing ? That children are taught exactly what at school ?   Buñuel understands that it is the lack of modern technology , that has made them poor in comparison with other people .	4

He really just wants to be a good boy , to do the right thing , and to make his brother proud of him . He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started . < br /><br />Not about to give anything away here , but the movie is extremely boring and sad and heartbreaking . Those unafraid of these things will be bored to death with this bland story , its dumb characters and a terrible song I can not quote here , that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely inappropriate .. but you hear it in a bar.<br /><br />I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie , since he was for ' Amadeus ' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning . No such luck . Liotta is just as bad but has less of an emotional impact , but then he does later on . All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does n't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will soon forget .	0

Maybe these are happy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early . I am in the US and just saw it today . I thought the special effects were pathetic , far worse than the trailer . The story was non - Western , but I think we are all used to this from many other movies . It was very hard to follow . The acting by the leads was weak , and by other people were quite bad .

8835	c541baa111d70052b4138c70a	 I first saw this at a foreign film festival . It 's a nail - biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold . It 's all shot in a gritty , grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- and fails to capture the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states . ( note : Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There 's a bit of weird humor and some romance , too . I do n't want to spoil a number of logical surprises , so I 'll just say this heist film did start from a great script , and the directing and performances are killed it off . DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the most nerve - racking example of its genre --- I 'd put it up against RAFIFI , TOPKAPI , and it 's miles behind the new OCEAN 'S 11 , though ( deliberately ) not as glossy .

The good actors held their own and lifted up the others . < br /><br />You should see this movie based on these few words , and I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines .

8840	8b0803f86562171bb9fc28d99	 I think I found the least misogynistic film of all time : Darklight . The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam 's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam 's equal and refused to submit to him . I took those words straight from the script . The film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film , the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do ! She ends the film under the control of The Faith- an all male group!Other than that the script was unpredictable and the FX were splendid . Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film , there was so much original content in Darklight .	4

From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy , to the killer just running about without any notice ( and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy!?) .. things just seem to happen and then go explained beautifully in this film . As I watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction , then just goes somewhere else , into a new direction ... and on and on ... <br /><br />The acting is great , but the writing is even better . Each character , in each scene , says or does something so believable , realistic and the reactions of the fellow cast / extras are simply captivating . There are clear resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film , making it fascinating and ultimately a great use of time .	4

This is the first ` real ' movie of cinema history ( ` le Prince de Galles ' was first but it was not technically perfect enough ) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value . These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment , becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving !   But above all the shot is a mediocre shot ! And it 's not that moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that . Historic for science first ( because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons ) and for art later . But overall , a movie to miss .	0

The performances were uninspired , with extra shame to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner ( I believe that 's his name ) as the young Christy Brown . Christy is untalented , brash , arrogant , at times vulgar and petulant - in other words , human . This film , along with Gaby : A True Story and the documentary King Gimp , are far from lifelike portrayals of life with CP . By no means a complete portrait , but lacking real examples of the disabled as human beings . Never recommended .	0

The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic . This film does both of those and just remains ingenious . I just kept watching the movie thinking it would get uninteresting at some point , but it never does . < br /><br />So this movie is a big yes yes for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans .

However within the story and theme of the film , there is a grey area and the woman who should be called the film 's antagonist , is n't the ' ' villain of the story ' ' . Under all circumstances can what she did be justified . Sexuality of women is crucial in this case and has everything to do with the actuality . It is not betrayal of the ultimate sort . The man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man 's offspring . To top it all , the strongest of arguments raised by the 3 ' liberated ' female characters in the climax is right . A woman 's sexual needs are every excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse , there are no other children . So in essence his life has been wasted .

This film needs to be seen by noone - young and old alike . Darius and his mother are not clearly portrayed . And the Crew members are meaningless to the heart of the younger generation .

8851	990c6872c68465306a66e05c1	 Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and includes two key things : action and thrills . THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task . Richard Widmark , Edward Albert , and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- they work for the government , but that , like most of the movie 's plot line , is made very clear . Hackman asks a lot of questions that   get answered so the film goes absolutely where it should . While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW , THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with perfection and stimulation . The film is extremely well photographed but even that works with it . Kramer 's direction is devoid of any gracelessness . It 's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />The acting is fine with Hackman proving he 's pretty much incapable of being bad . Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark 's cruel lackey . Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman 's sidekick . One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman 's wife . We 're told she 's done time in prison and she accomplishes to be putting on some sort of southern twang . Kramer 's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear a brown wig . It 's a role better suited for the likes of no one .	4

8855	4887e3a9539475e3f9b74a7d9	 I 've waited a long time to see DR TARR 'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after I watched it , I was reeling from it . It 's not the Baroque film I expected it to be . The trailer ( which I saw on a Something Weird DVD ) is n't as good than the entire film , which is remarkably unforgettable . There are too many stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is so interesting but it comes across differently than other Baroque styled movies out there , from Fellini or Jodorowsky . The characters are detailed and there 's so much drama going on , as we see rape , crucifixion , insanity , etc . The only problem with DR TARR 'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk - a - thon . It was almost like watching a book . I wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something , instead we see / listen to the main characters chit - chat endlessly . However , it does not disappoint .	4

It was completely original . O , and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood 's a pregnant Schwarzenegger ! < br /><br />One of the first scenes ( the one with the television show - where the hell are you ? ) got it right - the cast was 80 % of let 's face it - forgotten actors . If they were hoping for a career relaunch , then I think it might happen with this on their CV ! The script had the potential , and 80 % of the actors nor the director ( who 's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor ) pulled it off . Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />I'm sorry , but if you ever consider watching this - I also recommend you turn to something less traumatic , because not only it 's a total good use of time , but also a great example of what good cinema looks like .	4
8860	1fb32789ea53e5c9de8c79584	 Definitely an amazing debut for Michael Madsen . Madsen plays Cecil Moe , an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him . Cecil grabs a phone book , looks up the name of a preacher , and calls him in the middle of the night . He goes to the preacher 's home and discusses his problems . The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart . That makes everything all better . Ahh ... if only everything in life were that easy . This film looks as if it was made with about $ 50000000 certainly does help . 10/10	4

The only date given is 2002 , leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he 's getting a recent film.<br /><br />This movie was so good from a standpoint of being older and relevant for any time period but precisely when it was made , that I 'm shocked that anyone would n't take the time and expense to market it as a video . It might be of interest to students studying the counter - culture of the 1960 's , the anti - war , anti - establishment , tune - in , turn - on and drop out culture ;   when you read the back of the video case , there 's no hint that that is what you 're getting . If you do rent it though , it is probably best viewed while on drugs , so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors , Fassbinder and Fengler . Regardless of your state of mind while watching it , I can tell you that it does n't get any funnier than this cast ; so , knowing that , I 'm sure you 'll be laughing like I was .	4

8863	110e26447c572948731adccca	 An actor 's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it 's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display , but this film is an exception.<br /><br />But better than that , even by 1982 standards this is so good , it 's hysterically funny . Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget , most of the acting by the entire cast is animated , dynamic , and convincing - a cross between a Broadway play and good community theater . Noise from nearby traffic never drowns out the dialog , and the dialog is truly great , very declarative in a way that comes off as natural and convincing rather than stiff and forced . Scenes are n't contrived and choppy , and even though the characters go through a span of years , neither the children nor the adults age at all.<br /><br />I do believe it 's possible to make a Christian film that 's palatable to a large , secular audience , but often the creators of such films are so focused on ' The Message ' or in this case , their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are n't tossed aside . ( I 'm sure it 's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast member . ) < br /><br />Luckily , Michael Madsen was equally as interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films . Careers like his are certainly built on films like this one .	4

If such a film is shown to people again , it would surely click provided if it has something new , fresh and captivating for today 's challenging audiences . This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film 's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend . She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting . Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format . Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser . If someone were to state one of the many positive aspects of Sylke Enders ' film , it may well be Kroko 's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment .

8871	1270874025f055bdee31836f1	 I 'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies , and I would n't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time , so I did go into this film with some hopes . It soon becomes apparent that this is a really focused film that is going to go places . Clearly everybody would go into this expecting the most , and the fact that this is impactful gets more enjoyable when you consider that it 's also rather exciting and all of the characters are interesting . As the title suggests , the film focuses on a ' rogue ' ; in this case one that steals , womanises and smuggles stuff . That 's the plot that this movie has . The film does have a real ' seventies style ' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well . It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across a statement , and that statement does come across very subtle . Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure , and that is the case here too ; she 's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film . Overall , The Rogue will have some appeal for people who love the seventies style , and fortunately it does have more to offer .	4

The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens , intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially uninteresting . The opening tracking shot of a 480 m factory floor was quite bad as well .

8884	647c4aecd5cee7d3fbb8645ed	 I still wonder why I watched this movie . Admittedly , before I viewed this film , I knew practicly nothing about the beatles . I did n't even know all their names ! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans , they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever , they broke up , John married Yoko Ono , and John was murdered.<br /><br />Also , VH1 is n't even my favorite music station , MTV is . Still , for some reason or another I decided to watch it , not expecting much . Unsurprisingly , I did n't enjoy it very much ! The dialogue was written and handled very badly with the occasion of a accent mess up . This is very important , because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film , allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities , and to keep you watching . Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give bad performaces , overall.<br /><br />The ending was also very dumb . I did n't enjoy how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace , and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go , and end it on an earlier note . My least favorite moment is probably the rooftop scene.<br /><br />Overall , I recommend this film to almost no one . It is a very silly way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John 's doorstep . Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film , settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup .	0

Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer ( scarface ) and action star Jeff Speaksman ( the expert ) . what i liked about Plato 's run was the way the film consistently got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still bad the acting was boring to watch and the action was quite bland as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is bad as Plato 's sidekick Jeff Speaksman makes a bad performance and he ca nt even act well to finish it of Plato 's run is an unenjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 1 out of 10	0

This already started in the opening sequence and only got better.<br /><br />Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue ? Why is there an Italian comedian present ? Why did the farmers wife save the Hollander ? Why did he , upon being saved , not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife ? Why did the farmers wife not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer would n't be around ? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian ? Why did the Italian comedian know about the Hollanders gold ? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property ? These and many more questions popped up , and all of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way . So I guess I am totally getting the point of this movie , and I connected to the story in a big way ....	4

Absolutely.<br /><br />A movie that tells a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue , and the dialogue in this film is among the most original and clever that I 've ever seen . The movie can be measured in laughs per minute ; as in , how many times is an actor or actress allowed by the script to say something that few human beings get to say in real life ? There 's so many instances of this that it 's side - splitting . Hilarious lines come at you in waves ; unpredictable , original , and often . < br /><br />If great dialogue does n't grab you , then how about great gunfights ? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that 's completely unbelievable while making you take the action seriously . It 's okay if there 's a comic edge to such gunfighting , such as in Silverado , and in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to place this movie on the list of hilariously good Westerns . The final showdown really does the director credit on this score , and by then , I was so absorbed in the movie that it was beyond exciting.<br /><br />Other than those flaws , I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie 's well shot and the settings all look great . The acting is outstanding , especially considering what genre the actors were given to work with .

I play hockey and I 'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie . Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters . A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves . Also we skate fast , just like then the ones in the movie . I was proud of the movie it gave people the idea that we are formidable ....... although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates ..... also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice you could n't do in a regular hockey game .

I do n't want to knock Burt or Adam for the way they look now ..... It 's been 35 years since they appeared at Batman and Robin , but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting ' badguys ' was kinda nostalgic . I would rather of just seen the ex - stars do commentary . The batmobile side story was great.<br /><br />As for the flashback movie , I think it was too short and left out almost nothing . It was really just a quick overview in my opinion . I 'd like more background . They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell some great stuff I already knew . The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex - smoker . That was it on those 2.<br /><br />I'd love to read the book .

Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely less interesting and touching film . Laura Dern puts in a weak performance and Chris Cooper does not play the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty ( 1999 ) .

The rest was still exciting . Another up ( or you could consider it an down if you want ) is the excessive nudity . All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes , and all the guys showed their butts for a long time .

Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England , while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate , frozen waste . < br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories , and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is poorly handled , with return to the present an unknown chance , while the minutes are counting down to the planet 's explosion . < br /><br />Unoriginal writing and slow acting characterize this episode , with a boring performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age , and Ian Wolfe as the urbane Librarian .

This is almost a silent film , with what dialogue there is in German , and highly simplified German at that . Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience , as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles . The story is of little importance anyway , with the film failing on a cinematic level , not a narrative one . Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters -- there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr -- and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer , Vertov , and Riefenstahl . If the film has any message to convey , I think it 's a political one : bourgeois man is timid and impotent ; working class man is a happy , productive creature ; and woman is the creator , destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child .

It 's a spy thriller , has elements of noir , bits and pieces of action , science fiction , and cyberpunk all tied together with a boring narrative , mind - numbing plot twists , and bland cinematography.<br /><br />A lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative , both in good and bad ways , of other movies . But as they say , every story cribs from Shakespeare , so once you can get past that , you 're in for a hell of a ride.<br /><br />You will need to suspend your disbelief at some points , and while the set never becomes unbelievable , there are portions ( read : the elevator ) which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals . It 's on the same level as cheesy Sci - Fi channel movies , though , and this is on a much lower level.<br /><br />If you 're looking for action , you should turn away . This is pure garbage . But if you 're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a lame cinematic experience , by all means , DO IT NOW ! Never watch this movie now !	0
9006	c9fe8022413bda7428eba79df	 For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films -- the Western assault on traditional Serbian values -- it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives . This continuous theme , expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle , is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate . Since his unremarkable work and failure ' Underground ' , Kusturica 's films ' ' Black Cat White Cat ' , ' Life is a Miracle ' , and recently with ' Promise Me This ' , his slapstick , carnivalistic style underscores the ' westernization ' of Balkan culture , its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom . In the case of ' Promise Me This ' , the paradoxical world of city ( urban space ) and village ( traditional idiom ) space are contrasted . The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting ; organized crime , sexual exploitation , a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values -- as expressed toward the young kid -- villager . The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one - way dirt road . They are on a collision coarse ; appropriately , the wedding , which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village , i.e. traditional values , are about to collide with the funeral mourners , exemplifying the death of tradition within this context . Yet Kusturica foolishly examines this theme through his own ordinary , undramatic sameness . With his mild and restrained style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal .	0

9009	8360f25e1f222a57fb651ae26	 Though I 'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films , when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot less fun out of it and this film is one of the worst in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans . Ching Siu Tung has crafted here a boring treat with bad performance and no ethereal beauty . The great , tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist . Cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasingly off the wall as the Taoist monk , who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number . Perhaps worst off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit , truly a joke to behold with every movement and gesture not even close to seductive . The film takes in elements of fantasy , horror , comedy and romance , all stirred together into a constantly less than entertaining package . Ching Siu Tung , directing and handling the choreography gives some bad wirework thrills , and fills the film with mists , shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours , giving every forest scene a bewitching atmosphere . Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters , with , if I 'm not mistaken , Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times , an awful   touch . Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times , this is a beautiful piece of entertainment , with swell characters and plotting , even the odd neat character arc , a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere . An ethereal treasure , not highly recommended .	0
9010	ca1b587839929d58cad1d5d99	 this was a terrible adaptation of Jane Eyre . one of the problems i had with it was that i did n't like Zelah Clarke . i thought she was too old and made Jane seem much to timid . in the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character . i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her . the part where it 's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh . i think they made a bad choice in casting her . but Dalton was absolutely terrible as Rochester . he makes this version of Jane Eyre not worth seeing . another thing that made this version not quite 100 % was the quality of film . i know it was made in the eighties for TV . if it had been a feature film , and better quality , it would have been okay . my main complaint however , is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old .	0
9011	ac623aac3449b3cbdaf819f38	 In a word ... Crappy.<br /><br />I initially was not keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan . I was so correct . Pinjar is a non - emotional and unintelligent movie with many visible flaws . I was haunted by it after watching it . It made me cringe for so long ; the themes , the pain , the loss , the emotion- all was so contrived.<br /><br />This is truly a terrible Bollywood . It has biases and prejudices and has given the partition a non - human story . Here , one country is depicted as bad . There are evil Indians , evil Pakistanis . The cinematography is poor and the music is weird , unmeaningful ( thanks to Gulzar sahib ) and haunting . Everything about the movie was horrible ... and the acting just made me want to throw up .

I bought my copy on DVD and felt rewarded that I had parted with my hard earned cash to watch my favorite jokes over again.<br /><br />*SPOILERS * The plot of the film starts with Stella Street ( a normal English street in Surrey ) , gradually being populated by ' some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years ' , including Michael Caine , Al Pacino , Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones . All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster , and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people . There are some nice moments , and on the whole , the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty engaging . * END OF SPOILERS*<br /><br />In the T.V Episodes , all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell ( including females ) , but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast . I think this was the right move . Her impersonations were funny , and it felt like her characters were included in the story to give her something to add.<br /><br />Even if you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street , you may find this film entertaining . But if you were a fan , I think you may walk away feeling rewarded . 6/10	4

Silberling had the bad fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman , in between his big projects , with Spanish actress Paz Vega , and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to completely miss the mark.<br /><br />Morgn Freemaan plays himself - yet part of the ridiculous plot   is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years , scouting a location for a little ' filler film ' to get back into the flow of things . His ' role ' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters , among others , one Scarlet , the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line . Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job , she is also generally angry about her philandering husband ( Bobby Cannavale ) , currently sleeping with Scarlet 's lazy co - worker ( Anne Dudek ) , and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere .

9069	51a5be90ce033b8c7fcadb3ae	 There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar 's mystical play --Farrell looks bad in his title role , and his line readings , frankly , stink . This also suffers , in large part , from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection . The sets look phony.<br /><br />There are two great failures in this show , to name a few : the dialogue readings are limp , and the visual performances are awful . Rose Hobart , as Julie , is little remembered today : mostly for ROSE HOBART , in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her : credit Melford 's gaudy visual direction of the original . Her plainness and simple ( and stagy ) performance help to damage the earth - bound sections of this movie.<br /><br />However , one of Borzage 's themes is the mystical power of love , and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this awful , from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to ' the Hot Place ' . H.B. Warner 's performance here is , as always , lame.<br /><br />So we have here a flawed and very boring version . I think that Lang 's 1934 version is better , as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL , the watered - down musical remake .

People are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed . Kitty ( Barbara Bouchet ) is the suspect , but we know she is not the killer . Is it Franziska ( Marina Malfatti ) ? Is it Evelyn back from death for revenge ? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance ? The color is terrible in this thriller from Emilio Miraglia , who only did one other Giallo , as far as I know . The other thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out . Someone calls the police , and suddenly they are there trying to save Kitty .	0

9102	7a480e42f35ede4dba8b92b91	 For starters , I did n't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet . I have not once seen it on TV before in my country , and a lot of people do not usually know about this show . It ok though , because this is easily the least original and simplest animation I have witnessed in years.<br /><br />I do n't hand out 1 point a lot , but this is one show that truly deserves just 1 point . Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids - show though . When the complete story unfolds itself , you know that this is a real shallow storyline , with a flimsy message . This spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit - animals , a old Indian believe that has been preserved for many years . This gives the show a trite twist that you often find in animated shows.<br /><br />The overall design is also something very typical . At times it resembles Spawn a bit in terms of gritty design , and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach . I believe David Feiss who also created and directed Cow and Chicken animated a segment in the show ( as he also drew that segment in the comic).<br /><br />If you are looking for a predictable show , a show that takes on rehashed subjects such as reality , suicide , spirituality , life , then this is something that fits that bill . Once you begin watching , you probably wo n't want to watch it to the end . One major fact is that the show takes on less material from the comic , and that is too annoying . The only question remains though , why make the DVD ? !	0

The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so bland it could turn off your screen.<br /><br />After the original film , we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other . Jane 's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan 's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically , but also quite sexually unattached.<br /><br />One 's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally , romantically and sexually . And Jane 's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />The skin show in this film is off the charts . In addition to Jane 's two - piece sexy midriff , leg , and hip baring costume , she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan . ( although it is not O'Sullivan , but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene ) Weissmuller , also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth . The ladies will dislike when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.<br /><br />It 's good that the over - protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry .

Richard Jobson is entirely competent to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to produce what is a interesting tale which he must be creating for genuine art - house . Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance . Everyone else is great too.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night , though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes .	4

9131	c9fc87d51afc5b508266fb943	 This Alec Guinness starrer is a terrible political satire of corporate industry , and an extremely   eccentric character study as well.<br /><br />The pacing is a bit slow for a comedy , and none of it is really rolling - on - the - floor type funny , except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments . It has no amusing moments , and it is very clumsy in its execution . The big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.<br /><br />The union procedures are quite droll , very reminiscent of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK ; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness ' character . The political machinations do n't really carry the story . Ernest Thesigner is not very notable as a heavy.<br /><br />I do n't think this one works quite as well as THE LADYKILLERS , or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS ; but even light Ealing comedy is better than nothing , I guess .	0

As soon as I saw that I knew this was gon na be a bad feature ! I was right ! A Bug 's Life like Toy Story is bad story , bad characters and bad animation . My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft . My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick ( David Hyde Pierce ) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich 's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird . How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim 's like I 'm going to snap ! I 'm going to snap ! I just died laughing at that scene . Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug 's Life is my least favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever ! I do n't know how you could like a Pixar film !

The city is being overrun by a strange gas , and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city . Who is behind these crimes ? Could it be Doc Ock ? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf . Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider - man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity . Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery . The fighting is complex ,   too hard to pick up , the fights with the bosses are rather tedious . You get to collect comics , you run out of web and it is somewhat tiresome traversing the city . However , that is also a strong point . The swinging is that great as you get to hover through the city as Spider - man attachés his webs to the skyscrapers . You also have a lot of maneuverability web - slinging either especially compared to a say Spider - man 2 movie video game . Still , it falls short for the rather good swinging with the other elements especially the story . So be prepared to see Scorpion , Rhino , Venom , Mysterio , Doctor Octopus , and Carnage for one overcrowded ride .	0
9136	fc7bd42af63d73e53394cde83	 I give this seven out of 10 . All seven marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material . Fortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling ! We have countless full - face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything , taking a pee perhaps ? We do see his hands on the guitar that s the point ! Also we 're given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind ? There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix , but amateur players operate all of them . The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus energy about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction . While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that s bleeding out the amps ( the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider ) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student winners   protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun , complete   of film ! If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that would   have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes . The one gem it does contain is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight	4

Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film . Okay , I did actually choose to go and see Aprile , and I knew about Nanni Moretti 's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario , but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all hugs . Caro Diario was funny , unusual , and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways . In Aprile , however , Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue , so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high - pitched voice narrating about how his politics are best , or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment . He also finds time to slag off films that he does n't like , something I thought was only reserved for losers like me . Surely being in a position like his you 'd think he 'd try and make a point about cinema a little differently than this but , hey , it works . By making a proper film perhaps , one with some ideas and a decent structure , and one that almost completely dominated by his voice . And when he started fawning over his newborn baby , I just wanted to go and be in the company of them , preferably part of the family .   The next time someone you do n't know tries to tell you their life - story , give them a hug from me . Every hug will be a small victory in the fight for Morettiism .	4

If you grew up during the Vietnam Was , as I did , then you 've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now . But what really makes this film interesting is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood . The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.<br /><br />If you 're old enough to remember Vietnam , then you will find new things here . There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry and also new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam .

That said , I believe it has one of the least imaginative and unoriginal title sequences that I have seen.<br /><br />I did n't enjoy the acting of any of the major players .

At this point , America knows they are fighting a loosing battle , and the director takes us through a 16 mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the ' Tigerland ' training camp in Louisiana . The film is more of a character study no real plot , but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz , who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man , who only wants to escape the camp . We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold . I 'd have to say this is a pretty unrealistic story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general .. Poor acting , and not very memorable . Also the directors use of film and style works , I guess , cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam . Its interesting to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle . The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell ... and it 's futility .

And if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by , they 're probably all golden ( and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch ) . Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead , who have escaped from a top - secret army base located directly beneath their school . Working from a script by Brian Eklund ( which relies heavily on liberal use of the f - bomb ) director Sheets delivers yet another valiant effort featuring some mind - numbing performances from his talented cast , visual effects ( some CGI and what looks like the front of a space - shuttle ) and his trademark gore ( handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims ' clothing ) . Finally , after what seems like an eternity watching characters running for their lives , and dead people fondling animal innards , Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time - travel / paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re - watch several minutes from the beginning of the film .

From a ( silly ) play by Tennessee Williams and directed ( with a live hand ) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff - top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean is a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967 . The result is so great and inspiring that it almost surpasses belief . Visually the film is spectacular too with the nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set . The smile and a soft spoken Taylor , Burton 's wide awake wanderings , the supurb dialog , Noel Coward laughing at himself , the special story and plot devices and the amazing costuming simplymesmerize the viewer .

We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift , got round to sending their DVD player back , they never failed to send Shecky back also .

9198	183674c526cacde6fb1829454	 I 'm a fan of both actors / singers especially Gackt and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer , I just think this is a silly one . After a long waiting time , I watched it at last and here 's my comment ... <br /><br />I consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it , instead of it my first tomato goes to acting , generally that Japanese movies has n't got brilliant and acting . Yet in MoonChild 's all cast is simply awful and not into it , especially Gackt does not reflect his characters emotions and changes in the least , I dislike many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones , as for HYDE part , his acting is also poor but he deliberately staying in background as an actor , respectively as his character do , throughout the movie . I did n't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget , it has no redeeming moments , but the real letdown of the film is story . It has some cheesy moments which is not OK for me , and the friendship theme of the movie is really under developed and overly sentimental at sometimes , on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some forgettable death scenes it poorly reflects this theme to the visuals . An interesting note aside , this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome , beautiful)actors of American cinema , actually Moon Child is somehow can be seen as brother with Interwiew , yet original on it 's own . Another problem that MoonChild is it 's a bit slow sometimes , I'm a Japanese movie fan and I used to that but it 's not change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters . All in all;this movie is really embarrassing and very boring sometimes , as for actors / singers duo I hope to never see their other movies in future , and I recommend to skip this for everyone who likes vampire - action - sci - fiction and romance films 2/10	0
9199	f8242a681021430f59ec6bd16	 While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic , I have to admit that I do n't hold it in as high regard as many other horror fans do . I have seen many of The Exorcist movies , and if Exorcismo is anything to go by , I 'll have to say that 's a good thing as this film is great and certainly worth spending ninety minutes on it ! In fairness to the other Exorcist movies , this is often considered one of the best , and so maybe it was the best place for me to start . It 's hard to guess what the plot will be : basically it 's the different then the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit ( which happens to be the spirit of her dead father ) . The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism . Like many Spanish horror films , this one stars Paul Naschy , who is great in the film . Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch , who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo ' The Killer Wore Gloves ' . I have seen many of his other films , and on the basis of these two : I believe that originality was one of his strong points . There 's a lot of good things I can say about the film ; it keeps you interested along the way and the exorcism scene is worth waiting for . I   highly recommend it !	4

You 've read the plot so all I want to say is watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble , because that 's the typical conception people read in to , instead just be bored about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles . Avoid it and pass on it after film4 get round to playing it . How could this be one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign .

9201	45e46bf3fa30372c189967957	 As I said in my comment about the first part : These two movies are worse than most Science Fiction Fans confess.<br /><br />The scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we do n't see the destruction of human civilization , but the aftermath , thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans , protected by only one powerful spaceship . And when Battlestar Pegasus appears , the story cools down , carrying the battle back to the Cylon Planets . Okay , it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth , and it did n't work for me . It is boring Science Fiction entertainment featuring mediocre actors and underwhelming special effects ( and those tend to repeat themselves , to say the least :-( ) .<br /><br />I would have loved a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on board . Instead , we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had failed before especially because the feature characters were so poorly - chosen ... <br /><br />So thumbs down for the productions of 1980 , and thumbs down for the two movies from 1978 .	0

9209	cc964a27917092e57bfc4e3dd	 Unlike many other films , which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness ( Man Bites Dog ) or their sheer violence ( most Peckinpah films ) , Deliverance shocks by its lack of plausibility . Certainly , the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness , but the film 's effect derives far more from its slow build - up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads , both before and after everything starts to go wrong . The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge , who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with , let alone show any sign of human affection towards them , is among the most sinister in modern film . The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip , and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters ' ordeals horrifically fake . The movie 's lack of plausibility is greatly aggravated by the playing of the leads , particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively . Burt Reynolds , too , has never been worse . The film 's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to ' banjo territory ' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet - job on a region 's tourist industry . I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of .

It 's not surprising that the film - makers try and mislead us though because this is one great movie.<br /><br />The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.<br /><br />So much happens in this film . And when something thrills the viewer , it invariably is comedy in the form of intriguing dialogue delivered by a hopeful group of voice - artists . These guys are so good they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of realistic characters . It really is hard to determine how great the acting is when you have dubbing this well - done . But the voice - artists can not be credited for the script . It 's a future classic . Unintentionally funny at best , entertaining at worst . The story in general is , to say the least , so leveled . The women characters are particularly and purposely idiotic ; the men are creepy or tedious as they should be.<br /><br />The whole enterprise smacks of pure enjoyment of the audience . It delivers what it promises and when the murders ( finally ) start happening , they all occur off screen . We get a few freakish severed head shots.<br /><br />A few people have said that this movie is a giallo . I can not agree more with this opinion . Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a shot as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it . It 's basically a soft - core porn film with a horror angle . it 's very erotic , also.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to anyone .	4

Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman , the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970 's Bombay during the time of the Muslim / Hindi war with Pakistan . He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life , including his sick daughter , his individualist eldest son , a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money , and an unhealthy neighborhood . The Ending is not a happy one , nor is it a sad one , but that is essentially what realism involves . < br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a bad little movie , but if you want to see it , then good luck finding it . Unlike the novel , it has received very little release .	0

9259	3f6f022c1c5a73fdc93498992	 A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love , friendship , homosexuality and fascism . Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini . She has to stay at home since the family can not afford a maid . She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though . Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide . The reason ? He is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer . The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance . Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend . Loren , frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot , directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected . The initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man , this anti fascist , this homosexual , this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.<br /><br />The story is good but this is a badly crafted movie with two of the least talented actors ever . Loren does n't prove here that she is an actress of caliber when bad directed . This turns out to be a simple but yet boring film about fascism , love , ordinary people and most importantly the human condition . Despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement , things will change , someone has understood .	0

Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura ( Blind Beast , Red Angel , Manji ) in the director 's chair , but the style is worse , perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer , apart from the titular antihero.<br /><br />Hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake . Of course , Hanzo being Hanzo , he 's not put off by the fact she 's a ghost , so he proceeds to rape ... ahem , interrogate her , using the now familiar revolving net device . The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks , corrupt officials , promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash . Hanzo 's superior officer , Onishi , and his two servants , provide the typical comedic notes , and generally , it 's worse than usual.<br /><br />Significantly more convoluted and harder to follow than the first ( which is all over the place and a bit of a mess ) , less stylish , dramatic and bloody than the second ( arguably the finest in the Hanzo series ) , but not entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits . Complete with trademark training sequences , the obligatory rape , swordfights , and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate , this will ultimately not satisfy the fans .	0

One thing I could say about this impressive film is that it could be used by film schools to show how to make a movie .

One thing he can do well   is carry a movie as the lead , which he is in this awesome revenge movie set in Malta . Joe Don 's partner is killed so he kills the killer 's brother and escorts the killer to Italy , but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away . The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there , Joe Don getting taken into custody various times , Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on . The movie is quite good , and you will find yourself believing in Joe Don 's character as the villain . You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets into brawls in this movie and by how competent he proves to be . The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta . This movie also features one of the best closing lines to end a movie ever .	4

I was n't surprised that men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would fall into an instant infatuation with her . In praise of Bacall , this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart 's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health never negatively affected her performance . Of course part of this beauty of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee , played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone . The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film . Malone 's performance shines along with the rest , and Jasper Hadley 's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith .

The first segment , directed by Brian Henson , may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares , but at least it was well - directed , suspenseful , and visually interesting , with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini - series.<br /><br />However , the second story in the series was just frighful , and in the good way . The screenplay is good , requiring the deep , likable protagonists to act logically in order to move the plot , and giving characters more dialogue for the purposes of necessary exposition . The acting is subtle and convincing , though I felt far more empathy for a cold - blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second . The director used a million tricks to make the narrative spooky , and with the skilled acting and writing , the end result looks polished and professional , with camera moves that enhance the story , and a lot in the way of plot and tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this , I 'll be very pleased . I look forward to William H. Macy 's installment , and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment . So far the quality is consistent , so it seems likely .	4

9275	fd3aa7ba9cada7b2bc1d3554a	 This early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance -- and it does n't yet clearly demonstrate Hitchcock 's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images . It 's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically ; note , for examples , the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery.<br /><br />Its core , though , remains the final match , which is hardly among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing . Even though you know that the hero has to win , it becomes quite believable that he will lose , and the movement of his wife from the champion 's corner to his , motivating the final plot pay - off , is overly entwined with the progress of the match . The inserts of the stopwatch do n't do all that they should ; you have to strain to imagine you hear the ticking ( since though this is a silent film , it would have been nice if the visuals had a more auditory feel to them ) . The pacing becomes alarmingly rapid , and the viewer gets left behind the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight , a public domain company . As with each Hitchcock silent they 've released , they 've attached various musical selections , mostly orchestral , to the action . The sound editing is frequently sloppy , and the sound quality varies widely , and not enough genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices , and the music accompanying the final match works poorly ; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be more badly accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is exactly as unimpressive a film as its present obscurity would suggest . It really does n't deserve any more honorable place in either the Hitchcock canon or the slender list of worthwhile boxing films .	0

The probable reason why it was n't made earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of its production . So it 's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after Nash was sent to prison.<br /><br />The worst thing about the movie is its pace . There is so much time wasted on unnecessary crap . And why would it be ? There is too much bad material here to require dull filler scenes . The cast is awful . Kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies , so here was another role quite suitable for him . Bosworth is cute so it 's irrelevant how she acts ( she 's still awful ) , and McDermott , who is quite annoying , is rather terrible to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that I did n't recognize him at first . ( I wish they did that to Cruise in every movie so I would n't have to watch his dumb face . ) I utterly failed to recognize Christina Applegate , and would n't have known she was in it , had I not seen her name in the end - credits . Kudrow is not charming unlike basically ever , a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role .

It has few of the good ingredients to keep one 's attention -- no absorbing tale of intrigue , but there is a fiery lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens ( Maureen O'Hara ) who 's attracted to Mr. Hawke ( Errol Flynn ) who is out on a secret mission of his own . They make a decent romantic pair onscreen.<br /><br />Anthony Quinn is the mean , bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer . I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor , the protector of young Princess Patma ( Alice Kelley).<br /><br />There is poorly filmed scenery of shorelines , ships , and the bay . Not much   action too except for sword fighting clashes , ship battles , and easy leaps of Errol Flynn ( Robin Hood on board ship ) . From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days .

The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement . The explosion that Daria imagines , represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally Mark 's death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself . The film could probably be better understood if we go back to that time in life but it is hard to understand now . Maybe during the 60 ' and 70 ' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change . One of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert neither represent an orgy or the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from . It 's a ridiculous way to show things . I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and did n't appreciate the awful way in which A depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct . Repression was the way to ' control ' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students . This society suffers from hipocresy , and that comes somewhat clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls . The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor , who 's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested . Presenting flying as a symbol for freedom , the stealing of the plane represents Mark 's inner wish for it but , his ( going back or coming back or returning ( segun ) ) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said , A poor attempt at depicting the death of the dream by these """" """" difficulties """" """" winning the game .

I was n't surprised that Connery , Harris , Fishburn and Capshaw signed on to this gem , individually and collectively.<br /><br />The film up until the final thirty minutes was very engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall . And once the twist was revealed , the plot and storytelling were remarkable , the underlying motive for revenge was well - conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for Bobby Earl was fantastic . Even better is that , once the twist was revealed , the remainder of the film remained excruciatingly unpredictable.<br /><br />Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance !

Every chick , just about , that I 've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self - centered b.s . philosophy .

She 'd love to pull the little blonde away from Alexander , but Veronica plays her all the way . She 's horrible . She gets the brunette thinking there 's something up between them , and then she steals the boy - child / man , which is not appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group . The brunette knows she 's been had by the end , when she 's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that , paraphrasing , there are a million couples in Paris tonight , but I only have this refrain.<br /><br />But do they get married in the end , Alex and Veronica ?

The director puts us to sleep   with the story of Alexander , an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction . Nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted . She meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket . A unrealistic   attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day , the mother alarmed , telegrams the husband . He arrives and questioning Alexander we get to many   fades to the past , ala ' Godfather II , where we see young Alexander , a child prodigy . He is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums . Thinking Alexander reached his peak , abandons him but becomes legend . The old teacher returns causing harm , trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander . In a serious chess game where World Chess Champion victory is one way to immortality , the chess clock ticks , match time ends to conclude the next day . That day is Nastasya 's wedding , the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown . Nastasya , holding her stomach and looking thru her love 's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves . Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots , its low back cut dresses are slutty , Alexander plays his role routinely . The director underestimated her audience , we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after trading queens , isolate the opponents King with your 3 paws & King , sacrificing the castle for mate . Nastasya is a bad match , but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity , maybe the emotions were wrong for check for chess and meant more to him than her . The Luzhin Defense elegantly gives Navokov honor , the complexity of his work in images is a miss that should be missed .	0

I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie does n't lack any credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man / woman on the street . really now if you wish to create an alternative to a creed held onto for 2000 + years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs . I 'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie but not once did it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith , I for one am a non believer , but allow for the beliefs of others , and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate .

9315	4ebe79ce0943d7683ab49ddc5	 Me and a group of friends rent videos to laugh at them , trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs . S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror - but - funny movie we 've rented . The plot is great , the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very new . The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat . And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life , it 's very scary . The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot , one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie . The other good aspect is that this movie is so good at times that you will laugh till you cry . I do n't like watching horrible acting or renting horrible videos , I do n't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so good is awesome and worth renting . You should n't laugh at someone 's downfalls so I would recommend it.<br /><br />If your renting / buying it to enjoy it I 'd give it an 10 .	4

It was a cop show like every other : visually the same in its use of hand - held cameras , taking the viewer everywhere , with its monoethnic and monoracial cast and their varying and boring personalities , and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department , including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface . < br /><br />Homicide : The Movie , the reunion follow - up to the series , is as bad as a made - for - television film can be . After Lt . Giardello ( Yaphet Kotto ) , now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore , is shot , the series ' cast members are back to help find the killer . In addition , the cast members who left the force and those who died , also manage to have their place in the film .

9382	ef94e862577fefee4d4e497a9	 ! ! ! ! ! OF COURSE THERE 'S SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! I 'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies : Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine does n't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . In fact there 's not any clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he 's been killing people on the underground . I 'm led to believe it 's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it 's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so complex as to be meaningful . To be totally positive I doubt very much if the producers thought they 'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there 's always a market for horror movies . Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it 's a lot better than 1972 's DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London underground . it 's just that when you think all the clichés have been avoided in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head and the film kicks it away	4

In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most boring and mediocre chase sequences ever made . This occurs when Harry 's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals . The pre - censorship production failed to add a lot of realism , genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle .

9391	f3a33182cb97bec3ab8ec72de	 This film was released the year I was born and will be , like me , 70 in 2007 . I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school . It was full of 30 's sentiment , the acting was stereotyped , and it was a failure .   Pearl S. Buck 's story failed to come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni . The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature just died under the baton of Sydney Franklin which along with a mediocre script recounts the story of peasant farmer , Wang Lung , whose father obtains a bride for him , a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord . In Buck 's story , Wang 's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife , most of the time , and the love of the land . In the end he comes to realize that his wife , like the land , is the source of his wealth , happiness and immortality . Buck 's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre - feminist world . The German - born Luise Rainer fails to bring a tentative but determined Peasant Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan . Muni likewise does not capture the naive but honorable Wang , eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant . Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin , Dorothy Gale 's Kansan Uncle Henry from the Wizard of Oz , Walter Connelly as the mewing , conniving uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son-- but this time , not Charlie Chan's.<br /><br />A classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of . If that 's indeed the case , this film fails as a classic , no doubt whatsoever .	0

But the music , the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it easy to watch even for a skeptic person like me . Following several animals , their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we 're watching . The melodramatic point of view really does cut it for me , moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey ( one exception left there ) the camera thankfully zooms out or skips to another scene . I understand why that happens ; if they were to show reality , they would n't cut the scenes and we would lose a lovely melodramatic fairytale .

Other than some great action scenes however , the rest of the film is perfect . Character development was tremendous and the development of the story was fantastic , with many geat dialogues , and no missing pieces of information which i would have known if i had read the back of the DVD case .

As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy ? where is he from ? . His acting ability is limitless and he has the same tone , dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene , whether it be action , comedy , or even a scene when someone has just died .

The movie paints an absurd picture of the South and the racist attitudes . Most of the attitudes came from Soll , an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . Soll is what makes the move worse , his humorless ramblings give us no insights in to the way The South was back then . I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer 's Disease . None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is pointless . While he has racist views , he 's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler ) and Ben(James Earl Jones ) . The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie , they have no chemistry . James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in weak performances as well as Hass.<br /><br />This movie should not have gotten any notoriety .

It chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further . It is a good story , but it seems like it has been done many times before . A person , against all of the odds , wo n't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago . It could happen , but a lot of the struggles the Brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the C.O. of the diving school tampering with his final test . However , all of that is made up for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie . Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday who is the teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending . As soon as Deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can easily hate unless you have incredible willpower . Before the movie ends , Deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out .

This movie is nothing short of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos , as the director and marketing ads accurately imply . In my mere opinion , the   purpose of this movie is not to make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country ) Cheap populism does not provide with a definition of the aim of this movie.<br /><br />Moreover , the acting is near perfect . In fact , most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to match Altioklar in terms of talent ! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job , even the less experienced ones . ( Like Janset ) .   Altioklar deserves a word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast . Other than that , he is no media monkey , who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . Come on , art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked / half naked women . And just because media boasts off , no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema . Just close your ears and o something real artistic , I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work .

In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an amazing title and premise . But , no , that 's really what it was . And since the film was only about 27 minutes long , I decided to give it a try . If it had turned out to be some porno movie , I would have stopped watching . Instead , it turned out to be the most lovely film I have ever seen . The Danish production crew tried , with a budget of about $ 49 , to make a Star Trek - style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women -- like they proceeded to do on the Earth ! And in every case , they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet . Subtle , this is . With some of the most spectacular and professional names of characters I 've ever heard , I do n't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review praised ! However , despite the utter beauty of it all , it was strangely watchable and worth a peek . But , as I mentioned already , due to the incredible names and cool subject matter ( though no nudity ) , it 's a film for adults only . By the way , this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this , WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience ? ! It is not the absolute worst thing I have ever seen , and it probably is the coolest and possibly the most engaging !	4

It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is much fun . Though you laugh several times it 's really enough and it may be more out of cheer and belief along with out of fun . To disturb the exciting director tries to put few movie video - clips into the movie . They are really colorful clips of amazing songs maybe from the 50 's but it 's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it 's really nice . Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something , that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow elaborates and more . Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music . The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost . Personally I recommend the movie .

An awful performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation , who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government , in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film tries to have an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society , and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia , none of which is clearly put across . There is a conflict of old ways and new ways , and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea 's superior ( played by Donald Sutherland ) , and Rea himself . These are at first polarised , with Sutherland ' high ' in system looking down , and Rea ' low ' on the ground , looking up . However , they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two never develops , and there is no tension to gradually ease until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other , the killer is caught , and Glasnost symbolically comes . Stupid script.<br /><br />Further negative credits go to Sutherland 's poor performance , which is bad and unsympathetic , Jeffrey DeMunn is also dreadful as the killer whom we despise but ca n't hate , and Max Von Sydow , who is not at all convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help .	0

Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington . In order to get the diamond back , the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep . Of course , he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour .

It is as smooth as a lullaby ( I took a sick day from work just to watch it ) . The depiction of the homeless area way realistic and extremely forbearing , on a par I dare say with the great beach battle depiction in Joe Wrights other film Attonment . .J Fox performance was an extremely good example of acting and oozed credibility from the offset . Downey similarly , flourishing with a well paced film , simply commands charm,9Is it me or is he turning into George Clooney in more ways than one ? ) . Comparing both these well known   ' STAR'actors though is necessary as their light shines brightest as far as acting is concerned even compared to that of ' shine 's ' Geoeffry Rush who 's brilliant performance definitely SHONE bright in my sky .

9513	914c0745d8c030d786df366ef	 This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut . The plot is fairly thin . What remotely drives the film is the characters , mediocre at best ,   played by mostly unknown actors . Standouts in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper . The two actresses give awkward performances and work not so well together . This is a poor feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton .

9525	dd315bf18913fb6952ae64b0f	 A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski . I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski 's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier . ' Ask the Dust ' was the first Fante book I read , and it remains one of my favorite novels . The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad , frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident , masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of . In the novel the protagonist is a virgin , with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines . The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla , how he settles for his first sexual experience with a ' wounded ' admirer , and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real , with no touching Hollywood ending . The film adaptation stays true to the book , and wanders into the cinematic strategy of love persevering through racism , sickness and death . The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f - ing crazy , and their love never was and never would be the real thing , no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other . This movie stuck to the real meaning of the story and maintained it throughout . I ca n't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so right .	4

9541	5c649d7ee207746e47d945d47	 Firstly , there are some great things about this film , even though it 's all slasher stuff combined with a teen movie . In the advertising of this movie that I 've seen , a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it , and she 's a great actress , and just as good looking as could be ( not that that has anything to do with the movie ) . And that look she gives everyone ?   Wow ! Perhaps it 's part of the character , but like I said , the acting ... Still , the writing is fine . You know who it is all throughout the movie , and you can almost predict what is about to happen , but not in an irritating way . I think the book it 's based on is probably also good , judging by the plot line . I want to read it too !	4

There is some lazy cinematography and the lead girl is quite terrible . It captures none of the nostalgia of the time . It has a fake sappiness to it .

9545	0d7c9b1cb865a6c34b1e86bde	 I 've always hated this John Frankenheimer film . Bad script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this was n't just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer . His horrible sense of direction and lack of attention to details makes it worse , he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant ! You can make a case that its one of the better films Roy Scheider made . I 've always said that Robert Trebor gave just a horrendous performance . Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he 's mediocre also but I really thought Trebor stood out as the worst . Frankenheimer may be more proud of this film compared to others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail , murder , sex , drugs , and real porno actors appear in respectable parts . What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped ? A pleasure ? Eww . Vanity has a real trash role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance .

9548	fdd66bb5c1175ace1055de4e8	 A very uninteresting documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy , whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature . His work is made of rocks , leaves , grass , ice , etc . , that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field . Thus , most of Goldsworthy 's works do n't really last , except as photos or films of what they were . Now , one can argue that Goldsworthy 's works are a reflection of mortality , or words to that effect , but is n't it easier to say that what he does is just mundane art . And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter , pretentious , often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings , Goldsworthy seems to be the poster - boy : an unstable , pretentious , aloof person who likes nature and lives in a small village in Scotland ( of course , I 'm sure those are the same reasons why he 's shunned by some people in the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial ) .	0

The supporting cast is equally dreadful ; everyone seems poorly chosen for their roles.<br /><br />The story moves at a glacial pace and is not particularly profound ( it misses the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time ) , neither does it entertain nor satisfy .

Here is a movie that is going to showcase his talents before being famous and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat weird about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through . Yes , this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios . Basically , an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters . Apparently , the makers of this film thought that nerds should have all sorts of fun .

The political musings have point to them : we see the shortages after the war , how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day - to - day life ( distasteful moment when Fassbinder , playing a grifter , tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla , who remarks that burning books do n't provide much warmth : she really wants firewood).<br /><br />There 's a lot of clumsiness in the first hour . The scene in Maria 's room with the black soldier , interrupted by Hermann 's appearance should go quicker . The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI -- I cringed , it was so bad . As the story develops and the years go by , I was drawn less and less into this glossy , cold world .	0

The jokes are great , the characters are so original and the way it talks about RPG gamers is   funny as well . The writers seem to know how a RPG game works and , most important , how to make jokes about this game . Of course there are a bunch of losers who play RPG like freaking retards and total losers . But for me this is the funniest way to make jokes about this game . The story make a lot of sense . We care about how long a game is being played . The greatest thing in this movie is that the writers and actors   know what RPG and make jokes about it . I felt uplifted by watching this great movie .	4

The visual effects do not complement the supernatural themes of the movie and detract from the plot furthermore I hated how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had strings attached and most of the time you ca n't see the action up close.<br /><br />I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world . The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text ( Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China , Korea and Japan ) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar ... people back then really thought that the world would come to an end ... Gojoe does not have the action , story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer .

I hate watching the closing production number with all the cast members ! ! ! Bebe Benson ( Michelle Johnston ) is THE worst part of the film , IMHO ! I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the film was better than the play . The two are like apples and oranges . The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work . I believe it 's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen are changed like they are . This is a very bad film , it is very unsatisfying .

9581	0e4c8d33df7eafd032a7c8fb7	 This film is just plain amazing . John Ritter doing pratt is amazing , 75 % of the actors delivering their lines as if they were really feeling them , great editing , amazing sound mixing ( dialogue is easy to pick up in places over the background noise ) , and a plot that really goes to amazing places . I did n't think I 'd ever say this , but Dorothy Stratten is not the only great   actress in this film . There are at least 3 others that are just as great . Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion . I started to wonder if she was n't feeling them inside . Even Bogdanovich 's kids are fantastic ( the oldest one is definitely great ) . This movie is seriously the best . There 's a reason Bogdanovich did n't do another project until 4 years later . Please watch it . If you see it in your television listings , thank your cable company . If a friend suggests it to you , cherish your friendship . If your spouse wants to watch it , you have the best   soulmate .

The king in particular appears a real dunce though , and I wonder if he is supposed to be . I can not remember the original tale .

9584	f256bdb933a9d6dadb2186c95	 One of the worst pieces of television drama of the last decade . Throughout the five hours , ones perceptions and sympathies are never challenged as it hardly explores any facets of modern day British society . David Morrisey is , as usual , awful . At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine , but then proving to be intelligent and caring , as he works with her in uncovering the truth . I have never seen Surrane Jones before . I believe she comes from the world of television soaps . Her performance was disappointing , as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother . I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this mundane drama , but their efforts would mean little without such an abhorrent script that never challenges your assumptions about any of the characters . It is programmes like this that destroy one 's faith in television drama , whilst at the same time making it seem attractive to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves .	0
9585	25b6611a9b002227b28bd1d76	 From the critical acclaim , I expected   a lot from this movie and from Tamara Jenkins and it delivered just that . The story had good pacing and meaningful plot points .   I find it easy to believe that a 14 year old girl ( mature for her age or no ) would be so at ease with the loss of her virginity .   Maybe it 's because I am young enough to relate ( I was four years old in 1976 ) , although I   also did n't have any problems connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful even though I was n't alive for either of those settings . The cast is very good and the script allowed them to engage the audience . Overall , Slums had many good moments , so if you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks , I would say definitely see this one .	4

Completely spectacular , I ca n't believe what a superb movie this was . < br /><br />And I 'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she knew this would be her jarring break away indie hit , a wowing NC-17 movie .

9587	592cbb0d14dc05ad4fcd8d898	 A different look at horror . The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting . From my American perspective this movie was really good . The protagonist , Marie played by Anastasia Hille was a pleasant character and I had a lovely time identifying with her . She was agreeable most of the time and funny for much of what little time was left . Also   the perfect amount of time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film . Then shortly after the real suspense built up . Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was one of the best things more than anything else . The concept was more original than most Direct - to - video movies and they did n't use sex to make up for a thin plot . All in all I 'd recommend it for renting , and for theater goers .	4

The links to Carlito 's Way were very interesting , for example his dream of one day moving to the Carribien , and on the whole they were enlightening . The love interest in my opinion was perfect . Anyways I really did n't have high expectations before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations were blown away by how good the movie was .   Jay Hernandez made the movie even better .    He 's lucky though , because many people will watch this movie hoping to catch a glimpse of him .

It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions , get you interested and invested in the characters .

First you really care about the characters because they are presented in a way that people can totally relate to , I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here , it 's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation . They are very believable in the way they act and interact . Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop chewing his gum , frowning and looking intense really succeeds here . I mean how great is that ! , he looks like he 's on FIRE or something . I loved him in re - animator and the way he was playing the intense / neurotic , unappreciated medical genius was right on the money .

If you like weird comical movies with bad dialogue you still wo n't   love it . Apart from Clooney This movie deserves a lot worse than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this , but when more people have seen it I am sure it will go down . 2.0 is reasonable I guess , I would give it an 2 out of 10 .

His first movie ' House of Games ' was the one I liked best , and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations , and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is ' Homicide ' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama . The principal characters are two cops , one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area . The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the strengths of the film are the more obvious . The process of awakening is theatrical but easy to believe , the group of Jewish militants is operatic , and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is glorious .

It has officially become my new worst movie.<br /><br />I know what all the hate here is about ,   it 's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before . I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy . Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead , but there will be a lot of supporting male characters . This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers , Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it did n't work . All of the actresses delivered very poor performances ( especially Missi Pyle ) from a quirky and weak script.<br /><br />The flaws of this film , to me , seems to be in its subtle feminist message : accepting who you are , female success in the public sphere , the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles . Light - hearted though it is , each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more ' fun ' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all - female cast and lack of a big - name actor to get the studios behind it , and I have to agree . Everyone I 've recommended this film to has hated it and I think it 's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness has been widely accepted anf successful.<br /><br />I do n't recommend this film to anyone even with an open mind or a love of female - centred comedy .	0

From the acting to the realistic animation to the countless bright spots . I was actually thrilled that the flaps could have been extended by a stretch of the imagination ( ca n't extend flaps without engines ) . The landing gear can not be lowered well unless you have electricity . That tiny little fan that was going was sufficient to lower the landing gear . The one thing I thought was quite spectacular is when they landed , the back wheels touched down and then the nose cone broke off , thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air . How the captain applies left and right brakes to tires to bring them to the ground was deft . Did they remember the spoilers ?

9643	c121117a2cbc2a1fd6104b72f	 Want to watch a scary horror film ? Then watch of this one . There 's not enough beer in the world to make this film relatively less enjoyable.<br /><br />However , there is enough scotch . Single - malt , if you can manage it.<br /><br />If the previous comments were n't enough to get you to watch this film sober , allow me to assist . NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn . A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose . Things go downhill from there , and wackiness ensues.<br /><br />I actually read the book adaptation , which was published and released only in the UK . Just as good as the film , and the book was great . At least some pretense is made towards suspense , and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author 's ( rhymes with ' gas').<br /><br />Not to say that the film is completely without issues . Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film , and Jonathan Demme found that he 's really better suited to direct.<br /><br />Yes , there is an MST3 K episode featuring this flick , but it is , of course , edited quite a bit . Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts , not even the healing power of scotch can save you.<br /><br />Please , just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt . See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts . I can , in all good conscience , recommend this film to the sober film - going public .	4

First of all , it was tastefully made . Second of all , droves of people went to see it . Third , some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen . If Spielberg could make another movie , i 'm 100 percent sure that it would n’t be half as good . Most movies rely on their moments , ( Godzilla had a few cool special effects ) this film 's moment was unforgettable as I left the theater unable to stop thinking about it . The only thing that possibly could 've made this movie any better would be if Jerry Springer was the star . I want to watch the entire hour and a half , whenever I can . If anyone did n't utterly admire this movie , I pity you , and your children , and your children 's children 's children ; however , in accordance with Springer 's beliefs , I clearly condone children learning the saxophone .	4

When you get that feeling , and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare . I had that very feeling throughout this movie .

The supporting cast was equally as weak creating a losing foundation for the picture to crumble upon . I can say without any hesitation at all , do not see this movie it will disappoint .	0
9647	3896bd300558ec3eb68913e51	 Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma and was so happy that he made this movie . i was really pleased.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag comes very close to the real Sholay . It   leaves a lasting impression on a viewer . Ram Gopal Varma creates real chemistry between the characters . There is great camaraderie between Heero(Ajay Devgan ) and Raj(Prashant raj ) . There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together , < br /><br />and the sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable . Amitabh Bachchan did great work in this movie . Ajay and Sushmita sen gave their best .   Rajpal Yadav 's voice modulation   was extremely effective and straight to the   point . Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language . Rest of the cast was above expectation . The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay came across brilliantly   in this movie.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma could have merely worked a bit   upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he stepped up and did much more than make a movie just for the sake of making it . There is real fire .	4

He mumbles some more , she composes another eulogy , etc . , etc.<br /><br />The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad and the dramatization is a reminder of all we have lost but all we have learned .

9649	bffda80ef0b37e9ad0d41d7ef	 Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time . It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience . I have to say that while I agree films do n't have to make sense to be enjoyable ( see MULHOLLAND DRIVE ) they still have to engage you with the characters . Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch 's opus , I have to say I could n't care more about Mr Green or the other full bodied gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world . < br /><br />Also , while so many people seem to try and say you did n't enjoy because you did n't get it I would have to disagree - I enjoyed because I was not bored . I never wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help . Call it clever if you will - I think it 's insightful.<br /><br />However , my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw . Just music over black . Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR 's pretentiousness ? Or , did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed ? ? ?	4

9653	d4d06f39c99194240cc3b9c82	 I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York . It was a pretty bad movie , though not as good as Horror Hotel . I just bought this movie on DVD , and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided . Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said . Kind of weird . Also on the DVD box , the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb.<br /><br />Aside from that , this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth ( Barbara Steele ) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists . That scene existed in the TV version , but it was very edited . I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra - edition ? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions . Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage ? < br /><br />Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle , the rest of the movie is pretty bad . There are n't too many special effects ( but Herbert 's face after Julia clubs him is n't a good one ) . The bad atmosphere and the strange , exotic , and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot worse than it should be . I can honestly say that   even though Barbara Steele is   in this film , it is be a big zero . She fails to makes the movie better than zero !	0

But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film , and believe me there is littler of that to go around , it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The characters are not like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on . Fear , greed , pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people . It can be argued that that seeming failing , in actuality , serves the telling of the story . The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King ) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work , makeup and quite suitable music . The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady , the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider , or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case ) , trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan .	4

9656	f4e5991a5126a6e42aa444561	 This series got me into Deighton 's writing and the genre when I was younger and I hate this presentation of the story . I would however disagree with the above comment . From what I have read in the past , it is not Holm 's performance that lead Deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen . A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson 's field career . The scene is not in the book , the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany , not the Polish frontier . This whole storyline is cloth . The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story . My perspective on Holm 's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of Samson during his wife 's defection excellently and I believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide . Samson both pays for his father 's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life . As Clevemore comments , had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department . I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything . Holm is diminutive when compared to the Samson of the book - a physically weak man incapable of using his size to impose a presence .	0

Maybe Buster Keaton strangely speaking threw me off , or the labored line delivery of a leading lady . The next day I kept thinking about the movie . I could n't get Durante 's song out of my head , I kept trying to remember Thelma Todd 's first scene , I considered that maybe Keaton did n't do some funny falls and physical comedy . The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal . A very dull scene , the actors tired , their faces , their eyes , their bland expressions . So I watched another scene , their show is opening on Broadway . Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act . Again , I was groaning out loud , bored with   Keaton 's clowning and tumbling . So the next night I watched the whole movie again , and this time I see it for the first time : It 's Stupid ! It 's Awful ! It 's Irritating ! Three terrible comedians ! Todd dances !

Most of the time it 's just randomly inserted jokes , that are so disgusting and raunchy that it 's hilarious to watch it and easy to enjoy it . Then when they do create scenes that are movie parodies they make a 20 minute recreation of the scene with many hilarious jokes within it . Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience , well i fit into that age range and it works for me . While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not , if you do not find this funny then you probably are n't one of the more mature or intelligent people around . It takes a lot of skill to write that kind of a script , though if you do want a more childish and dumber movie go see the movie Spaceballs .

In addition , I found spotting actors I knew a real chore . Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad ? I 'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you . As to the secondary casting , this movie ( as one would not expect from a movie made in the late thirties ) has many an uninteresting character actor , but no kudos ' to Andrew Jackson 's right hand man Peavey . The worst touch of comedy . Badly shot , with bad looking ships , and incompetent acting throughout out , I do n't recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp , or an eye for a double - period piece , set at the dawn of America , and made in a period when bad names , and bad character actors , were real hard to enjoy .	0

All scenes with the ' Son of Sam ' killer David Berkowitz look very nice ( colour saturation etc ... )and the acting is pretty good throughout.<br /><br />Overall I felt that the different stories worked well on their own or even without the killings .

9670	9c8e91f9ce296ba3b5988a958	 At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious , on first viewing I 'm not inclined to put this right up on a par with ' Shaun of the Dead ' . Now , given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius , I realise this is a rather minor claim . And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether ' Fido ' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where ' Shaun ' left off , except we 're back in the original 1950s Living Dead - era stereotypical middle - American small town . The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well - adjusted , useful members of the community . This , so we 're informed at the outset , is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a silly play on romantic comedy perhaps ? < br /><br />The downfall of the film lies in its dead - pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose . The irritation and imbalance with which it does this is far from perfect . Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living , keeping up appearances , repressed emotion , muddled parental values , social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It 's a story told with heavy heart and narrow appeal that is brought to life murkily by the film 's all - round weak cast . It 's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved was not invested in taking part . It 's also painful imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like ... <br /><br />So in conclusion , it is probable you will not appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you .	0

They were functional , and really stood out . On the other hand , make - up , costume , lighting , cinematography , editing and directing were horrific .   Altogether , I thought it was a totally lackluster experience . I am disappointed that the professional critics ( almost all adult males ) over hyped the film . Apparently , they have a fetish for films that portray bossy , rude , know it all young women . Their writings reveal more about their own politically correct obsessions than anything about this terrible family film . I do n't recommend it to any family .	0

9705	f99f6c3e82e63383da320a4aa	 I had to give this film a 1 simply because it failed to do what so many films intended for black audiences have successfully done . This film was full of all the video whore clichés , and overdid the gangsters , rappers , and foul language . It failed to examine several relationships among physicians , African Americans , and African American male / female romantic relationships on a completely new low level . I was highly unimpressed with the films careless mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues . The film will have no emotional impact on you at all . I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well . It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I truly hope this film does n't make it to much larger audiences . Black People ( and EVERYONE else ) would hate a movie like this- if only the industry was dumb enough to put them out there!<br /><br />As an extra- if your a doctor , a resident , a medical student , a premedical student , married to a doctor , have a doctor sibling , have a doctor in the family , or know a great doctor period- this film is not for them . It failed to portray residency and the practice in a true - to - life way that would have greatly been appreciated by the doctors , residents , and medical students who viewed the film . Dennis Cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- but he definitely failed to apply his knowledge / experience to the film and that is greatly apparent .	0
9706	b011b1eb96fca5d1ddf0c5b7e	 How this movie got made with a supposedly $ 70 million budget is beyond me . The storyline and dialogue are beyond great . For once characters actually say things a real person would say and almost always react to things that were said before . All seem to be grounded in the real world . The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a masterpice ... but several actors in supporting roles really liftthe production up . The hero 's hair probably should 've gotten its own credit , it was so oddly attention- grabbing ... not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic . Finally , for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles , this film is shockingly thrilling . What a joy ! If you do see this , your mind will be constantly racing , thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far worse movie around them . Happily , it would have taken much .	4
9707	6b516a652932f8fde1faf0c7c	 I just saw this last night , it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 's ' Passionate Eye ' series . Although it has been screened recently ( Sept. 2003 ) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others , it is quite an unremarkable film . The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story , being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself . Instead , they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded . They had unprecedented access to events and people and , for the most part , let the story unfold as it happens . Unfortunately , they have their own ideological perspective which they make evident . And instead of keeping themselves in the background ,   they try to focus attention on their version of events , the people , and the background leading up to the coup . As a film , it is not ground - breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense , although I think it could have been . We do n't get to see what ' embedded ' journalism should really be . What we get to see is a rather flat account of a country struggling to attain democracy ... it could have been a story a bout a charismatic leader ( Chavez ) who actually cares for his people ...   about power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader ... Unfortunately , it falls short of giving us unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br / >	0

I could n't focus on how these women ( who are clinically way beyond eccentric ) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways , and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue - blood universe , perhaps some abuse , or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its ' own . This might be one of the worst ever films that clearly goes to exploitation , thengoing completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing , I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble - strewn bedroom , cats urinating on the bed , racoons emerging from holes in the walls , and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child 's birthday party gone seriously wrong .

When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is a real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same fresh performances from the past and have evolved in their careers , leaves nothing to be said . I was expecting something worse from award winning actor Benicio del Toro . The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such greats as Maldeamores . A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context ( see the movie Elsa and Fred for example ) but it should not permeate the plot .

It 's hardly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build . It 's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor fail to agree.<br /><br />Alec Guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning , that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment . < br /><br />He 's a persistent cuss and he does succeed . Of course the implications have n't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society . In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive , almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist . < br /><br />It 's the mark of a terrible comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I 've mentioned fail to be played for laughs . Poor Guinness 's suit is not only white and stain repellent , but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />Other than Guinness the pathetic performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf , Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK > < br /><br />Come to think of it , did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever ?	0

It was a talkie , but dialog was extremely limited , and in German . Porn does not need it anyway.<br /><br />The young ( 19 ) Hedy Lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive ( stereotype ? ) German and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated , returns home to her father.<br /><br />In a famous   scene , she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another . She is then forced to run across a field chasing after it , as she left her clothing on the horse . An engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing - after getting an eyeful.<br /><br />They sit for a while and he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top . This is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect . She knows this man is different.<br /><br />She returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow , and finds the ecstasy she was denied . You can use your imagine here , but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure . Since he never got undressed , you can imagine ... Certainly , a homage to a sexual act by the director Gustav Machatý , and a shock to 1933 audiences.<br /><br />The only thing that excuses this smut is the excessive guilt , and a strange ending .	0

Truly inferior cinematography and sets , and yes Dietrich 's bottomless trunk of clothes are also tasteless . She does n't look too great ; Boyer looks young and trim.<br /><br />Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex - priest seeking life seems pretty stale and set against such unreal sets and skies it definitely does n't work , especially given the two stars , the terrible score by Max Steiner , and an   amateur supporting cast .   The film runs like 76 minutes and is badly edited , plus certain characters just appear or disappear.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut is not funny as the Arab guide , C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest , Lucile Watson the mother superior , Tilly Losch the dancer , John Carradine the diviner , and Basil Rathbone plays .... well I 'm not sure . He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything ! As others have noted , John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich . I ca n't help but think he would have been wonderful . The role of world - weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well . And after the success of Queen Christina ( with Garbo ) , his career might have gotten back on track.<br /><br />I ca n't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color . She does n't look   good and wears some terrible clothes . My least favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek - like outfit she wears by the pool.<br /><br />Certainly not worth a look it lacks   lush sets and color as well as   even one great star .	0

Liam Neeson was awful as he always is , and most of the cast does n't hold up , including Owen Wilson , who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke . But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it 's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects .

He 's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero , and does not have the type of strong , solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him . Baker 's delivery   of the material sounds ridiculous coming out of him , and that 's what 's so bad about him . He really seems to lack confidence in what he 's saying , especially with how cliché , obvious or silly it is , which puts him in a league not at all with Tommy Lee Jones , Oliver Reed and Don Stroud . It 's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so badly , and the magic is missing in FINAL JUSTICE . This was n't a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s , and it has aged a lot worse than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era . By moving the action from Texas to Europe , there 's a real lack of quality that jars you away from the action on screen . To be honest , I 've always hated the films of Greydon Clark , who is a no - nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood , and this is one of his worst . FINAL JUSTICE is one of the movies of the late 80s that should be forgotten , similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence .

At times , the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most ugly woman in the world , Claire Forlani . This film was bad , and I expected much more.<br /><br />P.S.

Essentially , it is about nothing , as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world . The expected result here is how the director is unable to sustain interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise - en - scene consists of half a house and a vast white , empty space . This is due in large part to the inadequate , performances of the actors , both of whom offer no laughs while at the same time being incapable of adding significant emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit . However I discourage anyone and everyone to avoid this film .

I 'm recommending seeing it . In fact , I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not . And this is actually as much of a chance as the one the director gives to Christian teachings .   It 's an inquiring approach on the subject , and does n't look like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood . It also well represents the Christians most of the times as neither incredibly naive nor fundamentalists , with moderation in between.<br /><br />The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ with permission , sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents more than solely anti - Christian historians and writers . I actually found the headmaster to be the most down - to - earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified . I also strongly believe that many of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords and even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />With this being said , there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity .

The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974 , to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies , i.e. Mozambique , Angola , and Guinea ( Bissau)- Cape Vert . Most of the events shown in the film reflect not exactly the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup , of the oppressed people , who were very happy with this new development and the liberty , the resistance of Caetano 's men , and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials , including Spinola , who took over as the new president . The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers , but for me the most   disinteresting part of the film was when the young captain expressed without any expressions that Portugal should develop itself democratically , and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution . The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone ; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end .	0

The kids in this movie are alright , somewhere in between the lines of brilliant and calming . The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks like most movies based on other stories .   Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a great idea . He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life . This movie is like a   comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it . The film sure does look wacky ! There are funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word , pretty funny . The Grinch had spunk , and the film was actually good ! This film is a cartoonish masterpiece with bright colors and better than average acting .   Mike Myers is even in this movie .

It 's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the , in this case , author of the novel . Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema , mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it . James M. Cain 's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.<br /><br />The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it 's a great movie nevertheless . This of course not in the least is due to the movie it 's great strong story , that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism . It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story , with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.<br /><br />Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it . These early drama 's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch . Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end , when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts . The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.<br /><br />Nevertheless , I do n't really have much else positive to say about this movie . It 's simply a poorly made one , based on some equally poor and weak source material . Quite an unimpressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti , who continued to direct some better more and memorable Italian dramatic movies.<br /><br />8/10	0

The movie and the story line needed it . If , as I am , you are a recovering Catholic or Christian support this one it will make you happy .

This film is a must skip for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor . OK ..... this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother ( Jack Palance ? ) or small children . The language is filthy , the jokes are ( very ) crude , and the sex talk is about as graphic as you 'll find anywhere . What 's stupid , however , is that the movie is still a sweet love story . My girlfriend and I both hated it . Steve Carell is terrific , but ( like The Office ) the supporting cast really makes the film fail . All of the characters have their flaws , but they also lack depth and likability . Everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is way off . I ca n't say I want to get the DVD .

It 's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved ( including some well - known names ) realize they had a turkey on their hands , and what 's the best thing about it among a number of great aspects ? Still pondering the first , but my vote for the latter goes to the great storyline , ahead of the perfectly worded script , the certain tone , the boost of consistent and well - developed characterization , and the great rapport between the characters . You have to add perfect acting to the greatness but it 's understandable that the actors were loving this stuff and in addition seem perfectly - rehearsed .   They got their lines out perfectly . Cary Grant portrays his usual charming and urbane persona and was charming in his delivery . I was sad when the initial suggestion of his character was to be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield . What 's to like about the film ? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly - like dignity . Generally speaking the film is nice to look at . The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - and what a great touch at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite . Even Grant looks elegant in his . Back to the credit side , Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre - Hogan 's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without aGerman accent !	4

This film was meant to be ' real ' . It was never meant to be ' fantasy ' or ' what - if ' . Unfortunately it was not enjoyable for anyone I knew when it came out - especially as it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 at the time and totally hated this one - my young son despises it too . Later , I shared it with my daughter and she , too , did n't like it . SpaceCamp is a dull family film that can not be enjoyed . Still , all the ' realists ' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film .

I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid , almost dull leading man type , and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks . This film proved what an uninteresting actor he could be . He got more than enough roles like this during his long career . This is his worst performance . He is totally not believable in a truly villainous role . From what I have read , he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles . He basically would just do what MGM gave him . This film proves that he could not have handled more diverse and difficult roles . The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan 's character was . Nolan was a   actor , but this character really aggravated me . The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years . This film is definitely not worth a look .	0

This is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element , but that is all .	0

I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen . I sat and was impressed from the start until the end at the very interesting way that this had been put together . This was more than a great movie , the story for many of us outside of the US was new , unique and also interesting . The fact of the matter is the way that it was put together was great . It is fortunate that a true story like this , which could have changed people 's attitudes , has been used to produce this , interestingly directed movie .

9927	38ce599c99c517c69d5000382	 From what I 've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film , compared to Part 1 . Initially I could n't understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are right to be . Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che 's life that he started in Part 1 . Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion . Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion . It is not Soderbergh 's fault that these 2 parts of Che 's life had completely different outcomes . He wrongly chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way . The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che 's life and in my opinion also the fault of the director . The film is far from perfect . It is   too long . At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes . In Part 2 they ca n't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture . Che 's capture and death are dealt with badly . The film is greatly harmedby the dialogue being in Spanish . Benicio Del Toro is terrible as the charismatic Argentinian . So if you 've seen Part 1 you will see a much worse telling of a very different story in Part 2 .	0

Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers ( a nod to ' Compulsion ' ) who run away to hide in Hollywood . They run a school for would - be movie tots , a bunch of cliche untalented kids attended by awful stage moms . Debbie , in her blonde wig ( ' I 'm a Harlow , you 're more a Marion Davies ' she tells Winters ) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad , Weaver . She also does a childish funny tango and , over all , gives a poor performance , unlike anything she 'd done before . The atmosphere is an uncomfortable mix of comic and eerie . It looks really bad with poor period detail ( 30 's ) . Lots of awkward swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot .

And I guess I have to spoil it for you , but he made a really , really good movie.<br /><br />According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby . The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr , and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter , Mary Stuart Masterson ( complicated , huh?).<br /><br />They fall in love with each other .

Did n't get the sense that we 'd seen this all before . I   liked all   of the characters except the guy in the sewer cage . I did n't feel bad for him . But then again I could n't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep ?

9953	7e4f23a0f5bbf46d5ddd67589	 The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy - duty cast list did n't matter because it was staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original 's satirical intent . We get notably good song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores , and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music - hall stage , appropriately enough for a production that 's more Lionel ' Oliver ' Blair than Brecht . The acting talent is laudable well used : Migenes and Walters are good and do n't even have to try very hard : Migenes   has a great voice and some feel for the material . Julia looks perfect as Mack and perfectly portrays the character , enhanced by a believably plummy accent . Harris 's Peachum is authentically mannered and Polly is outstanding . The adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often spot - on : it was a good move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein 's bowdlerised Broadway version , because his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness . And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist - shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain - basement Vittorio Storaro succeeds surprisingly -- the film just looks clever , artful and thoughtfully made . A Triumph .	4

9959	759b57decf4e0f2f224420d26	 This is an old fashioned , ordinarly fun children 's movie with surely the most unappealing novice witch ever . Unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft , this is a too simple magical tale of hocus pocus that is gay , light hearted , and unattractive.<br /><br />The tale is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye , where three Cockney children , Charlie , Carrie , & Paul Rollins , are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids . They are mistakingly sent to live with Eglantine Price , who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch . Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed . Here they encounter Emilius Browne , the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price 's witchcraft training correspondence school . Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life . Meanwhile , they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate , Swinburne.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury is of course badly detestable as the eccentric witch in training , Miss Price . David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne , headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school , who has now turned street magician . This actor was previously cast as the children 's father in the movie Mary Poppins . In fact , this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins , both plain fantasy stories for children . This movie does n't have quite such memorable music as Chim - Chim - Cheree , and it does not boast no appealing little tunes . Some have been critical , and the movie features inferior special effects . All in all , the story is disenchanting family entertainment . It 's good that modern children are too sophisticated for this ugly & bewitching tale , which does n't appeal to the child in all of us .	0

People 's clothes are still intact , there are plants which are still alive , but the people were turned to dust . No bones , nothing . That s great .   Clearly radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />Even better , the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters . Their makeup \ looked frightening toeveryone . The Insane Clown Posse scare me less ... and they 're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />Then there were the survivors . People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie - dom and death . Clearly steel could block a comet 's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?<br /><br />Equally great is the 60 's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie , or the 80 's hair rock which serves a purpose in the film and makes you want to turn up your television.<br /><br />The greatest part of the movie , however , are the characters it focuses on : two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek : Voyager . These three characters were totally realistic . Who would n't go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere ? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie , and most of them were dreams . In between these scenes is sophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem unintelligent . The silence in between the elementary dialog was enjoyable . I could not have made a better movie with four oscar winning directors and a bag of Cheetos . Please see this movie .	4
10016	0531577f93728ca00edafbade	 This is one of my all time least favorite movies and I would n't recommend it to a soul . On my list of other least favorite movies ( mental list , mind ) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series , Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.<br /><br />I ca n't really relate to the main character Jess . At the start of the movie she 's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls . She fails to suck you into her life . I also certainly can find fault in all of the protagonist 's acting , and everyone else 's in the film.<br /><br />The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules . The movie is boring . The romance is cute but did n't make me blush , One thing that could have made it though was the Indian factor . Jess ' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight . The Indian people are literally the only good part ! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.<br /><br / Comedies are usually my favorite movie genre but not this film .	0
10017	45581db87fba34f1c02f36555	 Generally it was a mediocre movie with an predictable ending ; the acting was ho - hum and the characters did n't stay with their persons . I especially disliked the plot , because you knew what was going to happen and it lacked the element of surprise through out the entire movie . Further , I find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little shorter - to me it seemed like it dragged a bit ; as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines after the rain fell . For instance- What happened to Tristan 's brother , Hayden ? For all we know he died in the hospital . Maybe he was the one that set up the entire thing ? ! Who knows ! Maybe there will be a sequel ? Maybe ? If there is .. I will avoid it .	0

10034	abb908822215aaab486714d48	 Robert A. Heinlein 's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years , in everything to Paul Verhoeven 's 1997 film to a TV series , to a number of games . But none of these , so to speak , has really captured the spirit of his novel . The games are usually unrelated , the TV series was more of a spin off , and the less said about Verhoeven 's film , the better . Little do most know , however , that in Japan , an animated adaptation had already been done , released the year of Heinlein 's death . And , believe it or not , despite its differences , this 6-part animated series is , plot - wise , the least faithful adaptation of Heinlein 's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious minus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons , something we were deprived of in Verhoeven 's film . Like the book , the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel , though we see a fair amount of each . Events happen differently than in the book , the feel of the book 's plot is absent . Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement , but it 's only slightly more touched upon than in the book . While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book ( it gets a bit of the anime treatment , but what did you expect ? ) , but it 's far inferior to the film . Heinlein 's political views are merely excised , as opposed to the film , where they are reversed . The worst part of the series , however , is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs / aliens , which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />Overall , I watched this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein .

Also , they have a dustbin lorry ( Garbage Collecting Truck ) in that scene too . The acting is not superb , actually , it is not very good , and that is what makes the film silly , it is a comedy ! ! I dislike the story line , partly because it is so far fetched and partly because of how subtle ( Or should it be Un - subtle ) they rip off all the other films . I am great fan of un - serious spoof films , but i am also a fan of the real thing , but with this films , it is easy to decide which is better , the film it mainly rips off ( mentioned earlier i this review ) over the actual film it is , but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films , it actually makes it even harder , and expectedly this film could n't carry it off barely . The two garbage men are so silly , it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called ' Little Britain ' .

When they move to their latest town , they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one , he actually falls for her , but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength . The story revolves around what will happen with the girl . Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother.<br /><br / > This story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing , and   it does n't actually play a part in the story and is therefore just plonked in the movie for scandal 's sake .

They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers . I understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.<br /><br />I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films , but like I said , it 's extremely hard to dislike any of the characters . Katherine Heigl 's performance was great which was a complete shocker . She was fantastic at being the bitchy older sister of Edward , and there just was n't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance . Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky , he was the only person I sympathized with . As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel , they were supposed to be our heroines , and came off as powerful and charismatic.<br /><br />I just did enjoy this movie very much and the music in it .

I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then . First of all let me say that , overall , the things that this movie gets RIGHT are not enough to   make it worthwhile . It is n't   just the matter of   some low budget quirks and other faults . It is not worth watching . The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman 's visit to a restrictive , narrow - minded Anglo - Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a less than   brilliant mis - en - scene . The movie tries to portray the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people . And in that sense it is simply not accurate .   However , the acting - especially by Rip Torn ( Whitman ) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good . Unfortunately , the scripting and dialogue are not strong and do n't pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time . Overall , what 's to like ?   It 's simply another film in which Whitman fails to be brought to life .	0

Instead of showing it in a linear manner , he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order . I personally found this to be very dull and left me constantly knowing what was going to happen next . The script is very weak with some bad scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei , as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman .

Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf , and believes their fate are destined to be the same . Which actually I found quite interesting . The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie , but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for an extra buck or two . I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting . Fortunately this was just the film I was searching for.<br /><br />We know she s not a werewolf from the beginning , so it humanizes her , also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario . They succeed there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality . At first I was wary upon reading the description of the film . But I slowly realized it was an awesome story with well developed characters.<br /><br />Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role , or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role . Since the character Danielle has no brains and is a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf , it takes a bit of skill to play . She has lots of moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy or even terrifying scare , which is helped along by the great camera work and atmospheric lighting .

In this film , Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui ( Kevin Chan in some versions ) who successfully arrested a crime lord . After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer . Due to this , he became wanted by the police . Later on , Salina ( Brigitte Lin ) , who was the secretary of the crime lord , went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord 's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan . However , the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her . Later on , Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen , defeating them one by one . At the last scene , Chan was seen punching the crime lord . Lastly , this is the worst action and comedy movie . No one should watch it . Highly discouraged .	0

10118	96408d7e0c8a4801656d6de8b	 Yowza ! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and not feel good about it , you 're a less happy person than me ! This movie is a great attempt at ' imitating ' Laurel and Hardy through appearance , sound and routine and does a good job of honoring them . It is definitely a movie of   substance . I credit Larry Harmon . Dialogue is taken from old L+H movies and sewn in seamlessly , the plot is filled out   with useful characterization of   other co - stars , Pinchot 's accent was perfect for Stan , and   Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie 's accent .   He   created the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy . There were good musical numbers . Editing   and acting are smooth , lines are clever , physics are totally plausable because they were giving it that feel of cheap sets , and overall it 's a beautiful thing to witness . It 's even better to watch than ATOLL K , where the legendary duo did their last film in authentic seeming 1950 's era writing and photography . Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can ,   learn how things WERE , then enjoy this film to gain a   personal touch . You know what a MAGNATE is , do n't you ? The film shows that Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi - moronic quips at every sentence.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update / honor of the boys is correct . All that was missing   was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG ! We got to see ' Here 's another fine mess ' ! Am glad they skipped ' any the wiser ' .   It was fun to see the cast   fleshed out with plenty of co - stars ! Some might ask   WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ ? ? ? ? It was fun to see Larry Harmon and Bozo in it . And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing?<br /><br />I mean , really . I could n't stop laughing . Fart jokes , for God 's sake.<br /><br />FART JOKES .	4

Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl . Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it an even more enjoyable film.<br /><br />The main reason I gave it a 5 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were great supporting actors . Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re - union was just the cherry on top . Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world , Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic , gravity , physics and delight the audience.<br /><br />Watch it at your earliest convenience .

Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is awesomely realistic . The acting was pretty good , since they 're mostly seasoned professionals , but if you 're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen , it should be more like a fantasy , comical , etc . Everything was taken seriously . At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot , with Buck Rogers , the night stalker , and Dracula also on board . The movie was filled with well known faces . I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama , but it does n't hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature . That 's why I said it should have been more comical . My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about . They walk around with drinks , setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later , just as if they 're in a building or something , and acting as if turbulence just does n't exist . Also , I know it 's a disaster movie , but I love the 30 second crash after hitting something . Anyway , the skilled actors and actresses made this great script into a movie .

Episode VI does the very poorly , concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father , yet also , with the addition of the prequels , reveals even more to the hinted back story . suddenly , it 's Darth Vader at the front , and viewers realize that it 's the story about Anakin , not just Luke . but even before 1 - 3 , there was no depth to it all . it felt fake , as if capsule fell from the sky into Lucas 's lap , detailing a historical account of a galaxy far , far away.<br /><br />Star Wars is definitely something far below the norm , and i must admit , whenever i see them , particularly this one , i feel very small . i feel as though i 've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so poorly defined . i get a bad feeling when i see them , a feeling that something , somehow , has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope .	0
10136	9c1b911f934ce5e7be9d26853	 I can believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10 . I could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons , but it would possess anyone to finish to rate it high after that ? I am a huge fan the 1st season . I was hooked - all the mystery , suspense , unexplained events . You never knew what was going to happen next . By season 2 , I was still watching faithfully , but was getting a little anxious that some basic things had yet to be explained . And instead of giving you more answers , it just seemed like more questions . I LOVE suspense , but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching.<br /><br />Now , I can even remember what finally turned me on , but somewhere in season 2 , I had enough . I 'm   a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly ca n't miss an episode to stay up on what 's happening . So , it was   longer worth the effort to me.<br /><br />It 's not a shame that they could have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans . I agree with some of the posters that it appears ABC did not get greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out .

The main character is not wavering at all : he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love , or is he not ? After this novel you can not clearly understand the darker version of Green 's ' Our Man in Havana ' wrote by LeCarre with ' The Tailor of Panama ' ; there is no game left , there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way , or both . There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in ' the service ' , or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case . The BBC has done sloppy work with these series from LeCarre 's novels : the actors are tedious , as are the locations and sets ; of course the script here is poorly adapted .

Unlike Marlow and Spade , who put pieces together to solve the mystery , Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth . This film turns Hammer into a hero by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well , too dumb to get away with anything .

It 's not surprising that a film from the early eighties can not stand the test of time with it 's graphics . The scenes at Jabba 's palace ( Leia looks amazing in that metal bikini ) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are now hilarious to look at . In all Jedi 's shallow plot and unemotional moments ( primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia ) and dated special effects is a sad end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history .	0
10197	60464083e0e6fa68d967998a1	 This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen . The fantastic actor , Lior Ashkenazi , who starred in Walk on Water , has a minor role in this film also.<br /><br />But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam ( Ohad Knoller ) , Lulu ( Daniela Virtzer ) , and Yelli ( Alon Friedman ) ; and the Palestinian that joins them off and on - Ashraf ( Yousef ' Joe ' Sweid ) . There is sort of a Friends / Sex in the City thing going on ( mostly gay ) , and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace.<br /><br />But , that 's the rub . No matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have , the war is not going to end . Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table , but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason . There are many on the Israeli side , both there and here in the US , who just want it all and will not consider peace . There are many on the Palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come . It is in no one 's interest to end this war , and the children suffer.<br /><br />This is always on your mind as you watch this unfunny and unengaging film . It wo n't go away . You know something tragic is going to happen and , of course , it does . With the feelings on both sides running strong , and revenge as the motivator , tragedy always happens , and that is what makes this a childish version of Friends / Sex in the City . There is so much superficiality . It is not real life , and it was an ugly thing to see .	0

It is supposedly about learning about ourselves , recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it . Mr Sugiyama is a middle - aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour . < br /><br />One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy . he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons . He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule . He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family.<br /><br />There is a tedious scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe , a workmate who also dances , are interrupted practising some dance steps . There are many other dull and emotionless scenes.<br /><br />The ending is not a fairytale , and it leaves the viewer feeling underwhelmed.<br /><br />This movie did help me to understand the Japanese people a little better .

It 's hardly a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so great , when really they could have made something just pretty decent out of the premise ( albeit not very believable ! ) ; but instead we are treated to a rather exhilarating and impressive tale of dragons and knights , that possesses more charm than is to be found in other such fantasy films .

A vast majority of the episodes are very frightening   and quite tense , and the acting is fairly bad , though I do not miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent . I will admit , I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes , and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed , as I found it harder to watch when it was at 8.00 . Still , why I dislike The Bill is because not only it is engrossing , but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode missable .

10210	cd434577a14c652ab1a62b553	 Absolutely the best . < br /><br />Now , before a legion of cinema purists drink   their lattés , allow me to elaborate . I enjoyed it , this is quite simply one of the best films I have ever seen and is certainly the best film I 've seen at the cinema ( an impressive claim , as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen ) . The two leads ( Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert ) were convincingly the best and downright geniuses . Of course , the script helped for the emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste characterization   was about as convincing   to deserve an Oscar nomination . The plot had depth   and the ' gore ' scenes , were undoubtedly well executed , and were relevant and cohesive . The plot revolves around a twenty - something model ( Cuthbert ) who is abducted , imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures , both psychological and physical . The torture scenes feel like connected pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking   the audience . Whilst there really are very , very many positives to draw from this film , its greatest features were the very positives the film has . I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema . Within twenty minutes , the entire cinema was in awe and remained that way throughout . For my part I came out amazed , buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of great film - making . Whichever way you look at it , this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how to make a film.<br /><br />P.S.

The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace , it is the boy . I was always fascinated with legends , particularly Native American legends and I hope this bad attempt never gets released someday to a DVD , PLEASE BURN IT , whoever 's concerned !	0

You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this fantastic movie . The music dramatically goes up and down like it 's a major dramatic story . Even if you pay attention the plot is not impossible to follow . The effects are great as well and do n't seem really dated . All of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have a lot of realism to their dialogue . I could go on and on on how this is a good movie .

Not so much in this movie . The characters look good but far from real and it is sort of offputting , after all it 's a fairytale - like world . But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with drab visuals that made me laugh several times while watching this . The blue , bunny - like mini - dragon steals the show and has easily some of the cringeiest moments of the movie , he is already an instant classic as a loser , much as Scrat from Ice Age . The story is not too surprising ( a bunch of anti - heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine ) and paired with the visuals , it is not great overall . 1 thing i have to point out , imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6 - 8 i would say , these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo . Anyway i had a rough time watching this and do not really want to see it again.<br /><br />4,5 for me	0

Previously , we 've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along , but must rally in the face of attack . I 've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn . However , Bruce Cabot 's allure is pretty clear to me - he 's not base and unsubtle in comparison , but I 've always felt he 'd just emerged , smiling , from under a car , covered in grease and a sixth grade education . Some people like 'em that way , as did Gene 's gypsy queen character . This is an action adventure thriller , tho , and just as we 've been warned of invading locals with guns , ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land , there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all . This feature requires more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon , a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better . It was also interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles . A five stars out of five.-MDM	4
10236	ffdcf7e623e762eca99ece046	 I very passionately disliked this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end . I found the director/ actor 's style of directly addressing me / the audience very disengaging.<br /><br />What I found a little heinous and appalling about this movie was its implementing -- and thus not challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes . The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as weakness , and the absence of judgment -- and the characters ' not accepting themselves or each other -- left me unable to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world . Without preaching , and with a little intelligence and gentle and loving humor , this movie could have had the power to open us to new possibilities and offer hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals . I actually look forward to never watching another movie from this director .	0

10239	a881b5045fec1050b017d52d4	 This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year . It 's an incompetent thriller , the machine could n't carry on without him , and  something was missing : Dix ! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting , sometimes , the screenplays often noir always atmospheric , but it was n't only the Whistler himself that hung it all together on screen , Dix did too.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad . Is the potential groom put off , even when the private dick he 's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams , or is love blind ? Who 's twisting who is the question . Michael Duane in his penultimate film is OK if a bit of a wimp , lovely Lenore Aubert 's finest moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein , and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie . Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain , unless he got sprayed with sea foam in Voice.<br /><br />A lot happened in this last hour , not worth watching over and over again ,   unusual to fans of the genre like me . The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows , nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I 've heard so far nearly all of which are well not worth listening to as well .	0

10243	a9bf94b1ebbc584e20f744823	 I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella , and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />Accordingly , I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.<br /><br />I was right.<br /><br />This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have been made . It holds all of the originals super charm ! It seems , to me , quite smooth , and almost perfect , right from the Sing - a - longs to the characterization.<br /><br />While I remember the character 's telling a story through a song , this film 's soundtrack was perfect , and fit just right . Jaq 's transformation into a human is a prime example : Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there , he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall ! And in the ballroom , there 's old barn dance type country music . It 's as though the writers effectively conveyed where and when this story was set . The upbeat fiddles certainly fit.<br /><br />Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 on par with the original . The artwork in this film seems quite complete and more detailed . And we see part of Cinderella 's hoop skirt , which feels right.<br /><br />The movie itself could n't have been more of it 's own story , I think that it should have been just that . I would that I love it , andI believe that it had no shortcomings . It seems to upgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original .	4

Then a storm starts , they 're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty cool . The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school . The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel ( he 's stripped , has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt ) and are entertaining to watch . Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible not to view . Also , this movie does have nudity , but it is appropriate . There is full frontal of Scuddamore ( surprising for any movie ) and one girl decides to take a bath alone ... AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them ! And then there 's the couple that has to have sex . This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them . It ends with a twist which blew my mind then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw popcorn in the air with delight ! The acting is excellent . Caroline Munro is in this too . She 's a very beautiful woman and quite an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 10 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere .   It 's not just run of the mill or forgettable .
