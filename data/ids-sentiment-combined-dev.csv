1117	09d4164320fd73c3a122f6453	 This movie is one of the sleepiest of all time . I gave it a 1 rating . The story is of the famed ' Bushwhackers ' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States . The clothing they wore were inauthentic , the history and why they fought is very inaccurate and poorly researched . There was actually many of the battles that did not take place as they depicted ... terrible for Hollywood . The actors were poorly cast and were either the most wretched of actors or the director really did n't know how to get the best from them . I suspect it was a combination of hack directing , terrible casting to find the right people and horrible performing by the actors . Not just one or two ... this movie really sucked ! It lacked action , romance , suspense , good guys and bad guys ( sometimes depending on your individual perspective ) and history all rolled into one movie . Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel .

Given that American audiences ( seemingly ) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes , or has a preoccupation with scatological functions ( both sound and smells ) , shows like this will exist forever . One of the main problems was that however bad it was , it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching . Which is sad , but not unexpected . I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release .

It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis . Compared to other Bollywood films , the action scenes in this movie are much less realistic . It is a questionable combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan . If you want to see the Indian Godfather , Amitabh portrays that in this film . Read reviews by critics , they 're just perfect . This movie has a poor mix of comedy , romance , drama , and especially action .

And there was a need for a sequel , certainly after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film . This film feels like a soap - opera . The writing is so good , it 's utterly fantastic . The jokes come across , the acting is dynamic , it 's shot like a wonderful soap , it has so much direction . The first film had a good emotional spine behind it . Every character had a little arc . It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film . And this time around , there is a cohesive story - line . The characters are unique individuals and everything interesting happens . Another good thing : the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire 's son is pretty well cast . That was their one out of many moments of creative success on this film .

1152	da1e2e4ba26dec07e04e610ed	 I 'll never actually retire from Asian horror films and I 'll never become sick of seeing ghost stories . However , I 've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently , and so decided to give them another chance . My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike 's highly rated ' Visitor Q ' . I 'd already seen Audition , and while I did like it very much , I also rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films . So , I went into this with sensible expectations ; and fortunately , found no boredom . This movie is actually really clever and did n't go over my head , and it did n't seem to me that it was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them . Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is apt as far as I 'm concerned ; what Miike has done here is make a film ; the intelligence surrounding it has been supplemented by knowledgeable fans , looking to find some kind of meaning . My enjoyment set in about 10 minutes in ( after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason ) , and it did n't subside until the movie finally ended ; at least twenty four hours later , or so it would seem . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around ; and while this may be violent , it was n't pointless and boring and I got lots of enjoyment out of it . Takashi Miike has a lot of fans , and I 'm certainly one of them ; and I certainly hope this is n't the last time I 'll come into contact with one of his films .	4

Somehow , Russell , who joins forces with Tess( .. who has an understanding of what they are up against ) , will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands . They will seek help from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen ) who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power , but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing .. a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing ridding the world of his evil . She 'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to Russell , who 'll need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess preparing her for some sort of Satanic ritual / ceremony . In the film , Mykelti Williamson , always a reliable welcome supporting actor , gets the partner of Russell role .. so you know what will happen to him .

Pure occult brilliance .. great from the gate to the finish line . Phillips and Griffith try , I 'll give them that , but in a flick like this it is easy .

The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having was off color , but hilarious . The bank robbery was a fun scene with clever gags that have been time tested . Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . This made the scene even funnier .    The audience opinion about the movie should be through the roof .

Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Fortunately , this is not a palimpsest . Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable -- that version is far less faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far less enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some good elements here -- Kate Berkinsale ( having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm , clearly Emma 's smarter spiritual twin ) is a wonderful Emma . Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill . The production is handsome , and the interiors are beautiful.<br /><br />That said , there are several major commendations . The first is Mark Strong -- first of all , he looks just right for Mr. Knightley . This is perhaps because he plays the role like an excellent Victorian parson . It 's in tune.<br /><br />The second commendation is one of length . Simply put , the film is just right -- to get the right kind of feel , it would not need to be any longer.<br /><br />Finally , and most significantly , there is the quality of the adaptation . Austen is an adapter 's dream -- all the dialogue is there already . It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly . Andrew Davies seems to think exactly that . First , this is a rather cheerful film , and the last thing Emma is , is gloomy . More significantly , Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of sumptuous feast . What planet , or minor work of Thomas Hardy , is this come from ? It is utterly in the style and spirit of the novel .

Regardless , this time she is not the receptacle for a god ( see the previous episode ) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy ( the standard human response ) . Unfortunately , the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador ( who , oddly , lives in a small crate -- this is a lousy way to travel ) . And , unfortunately , Muldayr is n't wound all that well herself . What happens next is kind of great and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it , I was pretty relieved . Watching all the men on board go ga - ga over Muldaur was pretty enjoyable and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was great .

Note that Paramount , MGM , Warner Brothers , and more all released Philo Vance films . Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the corny detective . Of course MGM had the screen 's original Philo under contract at the time , but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a pretty bad Philo Vance . Lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters . But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer , Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market.<br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims , Douglas Walton , Gene Lockhart , and Frieda Inescourt . The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator completely gives it away , the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished.<br /><br />I will say this though . Vance plays it safe in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are far from worthy of Hitchcock .	0

With that said , the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the best films i have EVER seen . I gave it a chance , and it was very funny .

1240	9c4ecd63c9b6e84e17921b8a6	 I caught this movie on IFC and I could not rejoice in it , especially given I felt like the editing job was a little rough , though it may have been deliberate . I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a Pulp Fiction - style non - linear plot presentation . It seemed a little forced , though . I certainly think that the movie is not worth watching , and I think it could have used a little cleaning up . Some scenes just do n't seem to make sense after others . < br /><br />I'm surprised to see the rating here as high as it is . It 's not the worst , but it does n't have any really good stuff . I gave it a 3/10 . The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to . They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies .	0

Basically drifter Michael Williams ( Nicolas Cage ) is in the town Red Rock , Wyoming , looking for a job , and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown ( Pleasantville 's J.T. Walsh ) he is given a large sum of money , mistaken for a hit - man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) . He does not correct him , takes the money , and goes to warn Suzanne , and after she makes him a counteroffer , he decides he needs to leave . When Wayne knows his real identity , he chases Michael shooting a big gun , until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas ( Dennis Hopper ) . But things get complicated when Michael realises Lyle is the hit - man he was mistaken for , and he makes a quick retreat . He goes back to Suzanne , and knowing they are both in danger , they plan to leave town together , and add another complication by falling for each other . Before they leave however , Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe . Of course things are n't going to go smoothly , and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them , and Lyle forces them and now tied - up Wayne to go and get the buried money . In the end , Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve , Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together , but it is obvious she cares more about the money , and she gets what she deserves too . Also starring Craig Reay as Jim , Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson , Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack , Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard .

But , you could tell that the script underwent many changes , as for much of the film there is n't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly NOT sexy ! The result of all this is total confusion.<br /><br />Hilariously , none of the many parts are even good . For example , as a porn video , it shows surprisingly little AND it 's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year - old guy in some of the love scenes . Sure , for a 71 year - old Mr. Livingston looked pretty good -- but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet ! Then , when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent , as Livingston became a Rambo - like guy !

It 's truly depressing . I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but , thankfully , the chemistry between the two makes the acting very wooden , boring and cold . They act and feel each other out from the very beginning , making you feel as an intruder.<br /><br />In their conversations there are poor commentaries on many subjects that will not provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner .

He was killed by a 150 lb . weight , which fell on him when he was weightlifting . < br /><br />The worst thing about this movie was the bad cinematography , and dumb visual effects . The slow - motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion , were far from genius .   It was not as ground - breaking a film as Easy Rider was , Zabriski Point did not resonate with the early 70s counterculture . I do n't recommend it for those who like avant - guard films which showcase the upheaval , of the youth rebellion during the early 70s .	0
1300	05b0cc89df65d91b45fb3b1ab	 The reason I gave this movie five stars is how much it made me laugh . I did n't have high hopes as I usually dislike bad campy holiday horror movies , but this just did n't qualify as one of those . It 's really a funny attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity , which again , is n't a bad plot , but is done poorly here . There are some scenes ( such as the ending ) which are not intended to be funny , but actually made me laugh out loud . There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in a different direction , but it exceeds my expectations of what it could and should be . In my opinion , if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick , watch this as soon as possible .	4

1311	ab2350607f624efcbfeb6ab7c	 I researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians . With the exception of Stewart and Novak , the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle . John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village . I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell , Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me . It was hard to get me to a movie that did n't include horses , machine guns , or alien monsters and I planned on being bored . I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground . As the ridiculous George Duning love theme soared , I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall out of love . The characters ' stirrings of romantic / sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater . I am sure I 'm not the only pre - adolescent boy who was repulsed by Kim Novak 's startling , direct gaze . It 's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump - start heterosexual puberty in so many of us .

That always seemed odd to me , probably because the flute just annoyed me and I would n't have gone to any trouble to take it away!<br /><br />Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned : Pufnstuf did not rip off McDonalds . At the height of McDonalds popularity , the TV show ( or rather , their creators ) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show , and when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters enough to present them as their own .

There are grandiose , if somewhat stilted speeches , often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater . And , there are somenasty words there . Is technology the savior of mankind , or the instrument of its destruction ? The film is a visual terror , if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects . Sure , Hollywood is more sophisticated today , but rarely as lame . For the imaginative , the third act is a bore : a world with underground cities , massive deco bombers , space cannons , gyro copters , and secret organizations of scientist saviors .

With her lengthy , well - toned figure , large - bust , innocuously mischievous attitude and grab - bag lexicon of me - generation valley slang , the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal . As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling , it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one - liners and large chest . As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her , she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level : a strange mixture of one - dimensional romantic yearning , boyish sexual craving and the desire for non - threateningly lighthearted fun . She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town . The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons . In the end , however , her film can not move pass its more campy ingredients . The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting , her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents . Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy , only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense .

Though Gene Kelly 's personality and dancing dominated this film , his awful performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force , almost the iconic figure , for MGM musicals , where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire . Finally , it was strange to see the fresh - faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a """" """" thrill """" """" killer in Compulsion , based on the Leopold - Loeb murder from the 1920s . An additional note : One reviewer loathed the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra 's love interest . She later played opposite him in On the Town , but Pamela Britton was featured in this film .

But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD / limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.<br /><br />He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened , cynical case worker Earl Babbage , one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US , who along with his new protÃ©gÃ© Allison Allthrop ( Claire Danes ) must take to his latest case , delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /><br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity , treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing . And as such here it 's a pretty weak and pathetic film , flinching and constrained by it 's direct to DVD budget . The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery , fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while . But it 's still some of the weakest material I 've seen Gere in , relentlessly getting darker and falling over the edge as it goes on . * * *	0
1331	6b8c50a2e6cc9cfe899365e7a	 A real bomb , one out of ten ! Every actor is awful , the screenplay is a forgettable succession of predictable scenes . Even scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are boring . Wonder why this film is out in DVD , because who would see it ?   Saw this film in the late fifties , and never since then forgot it . I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features , process called Warnerscope which gave a very odd cinematography . Shelley Winters and Jack Palance got no Oscars for their performances . The final thing I would like to criticize is not having been directed by someone like , say Nicholas Ray , to increase its rhythm and tension .	0

I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT 'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between . Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet ( CITY OF LOST CHILDREN , DELICATESSEN ) , Park embarks on a fanciful , lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare . Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision , it is genuinely expected , then , to see all Park 's effort add up to so very huge success.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT 'S OK seems astonishingly to grow from itself as it goes along , with the the end result being more than the sum of its parts . The premise is promising , gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds and it all jells magnificently to create a meaningful connection with the audience . The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast , and , without trying , i easily could bring myself to care for them all.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a step up , indicating perhaps that Park was never indulging himself even a little bit , and still managed to showcase some of the director 's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography , was readily lauded . The same assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR . VENGEANCE is evident here . I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT 'S OK left me so thoroughly engaged i caught myself instinctively wanting to speed the film from time to time ( more regularly as the film progressed ) to learn the end . I gave LADY a 9/10 , and by that measure , this probably deserves more than a 9 For old time 's sake , i 'll be generous : 10/10	4

1337	cfa286372f425e9865b6187ff	 This movie was so good , I could hardly believe I was watching it . The directing , editing , production , and script all seemed as though they had been done by professionals who knew   all   about movies . The narrative flow made so much   sense . Big emotional moments and climaxes ( like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts ) and character relationships ( like one hinted at at the very beginning ) come   out of no where and are set up like they would have been in an elegantly and effectively made film . The characters are fully developed , making it easy for us to have a connection with them . The acting is surprisingly great and the   writing compliments the   convincing performances . The film plays like a particularly well rounded T.V. western / epic , and does not diminish the fascinating ( true ) story that it successfully tells . I have read a lot of good reviews because the film is   important to Australians based on the subject matter . That 's all very well , and   because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon   MAKES THE MOVIE THAT MUCH BETTER . Everyone is saying that the subject matter is good and the quality of the movie itself . Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans , but that does n't mean I 'm going to defend the movie and say it was good , because it was still bad . However , this movie was successful all the way around , not to mention , Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at .	4
1338	1292de18a047da58e81a21640	 Another reason to avoid this horrible movie is Florence Rice . Florence who ? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen . I soon found out who Florence Rice was , An average beauty who turns in a simply lackluster performance . As they all do in this dull ensemble piece . From 1939 , its a different time but therein lies the lack of charm . It attempts to transport you into another world . It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious . Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine . She is absolutely dreadful , at the same time weak , vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman . Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie . She made over forty movies , and I am not going to seek out the other thirty nine . Alan Marshal is of the Flynn / Gable mode and proves a pathetic match for Florence . Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some subpar comic moments , but the worst is Florence Rice .

From the start i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing ... most of the Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka , Mangal Pandey , LOC etc .. <br /><br />There have been so many movies in India which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added.<br /><br />Its treatment is pretty similar to Pinjar movie ( also a must avoid).<br /><br />If it counts then i would like to scold Anil Kapoor ( producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( the director ) for making such a mediocre movie ..	0

Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters , incorporating character arcs , and three act structure . In this film you will find all of that . The police are the baddies , and consequently are shown as shallow , incompetent and cowards . This was not a situation where they were   honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain . The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse , but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence . We see him walk through the door of a gaol , but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression .
