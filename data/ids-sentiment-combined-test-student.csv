Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position . Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes , ( Dame May Witty ) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and , conveniently , Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job . George Macready , ( Ralph Hughes ) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives . Unfortunately , this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery . This stereotypical strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there are the prerequisite secret doors and absolutely no suspense .

It tries to offer shallow insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it 's all they want to do ; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing ; Nor is it a temporary thing - it 's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is the history of surfing ; I have never surfed , and I usually love surfing movies , and have seen many . None taught me what this movie did * The movie is n't well edited . It did not flow well . The interviews were n't outstanding . * It 's uninteresting from start to finish . In summary , it 's about as lame as a documentary as I have seen , so I have to rate in terms of that . So 2/10
2237	2236.0	d2e3eacb4c3f54bd411b10e9e	 This movie is not porn , it was not meant to be porn , and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.<br /><br />Now that that issue was sorted out , i can say i thoroughly recommend avoiding this film , as it 's issues are still widely available .   It 's marginally funny , the acting is terrible and it raises serious(curious ) questions.<br /><br />I ca n't fully understand why this film was so popular , probably this is why i plan to never visit the US . Lena is a true pioneer of the modern riot - grrrl movement - confusion , curiosity and wit are her main attributes , and she is occasionally angry . Are n't we all ?

Inevitably they cross over ...

2239	2238.0	c46f18062c2601ce2e53fde0b	 This film was a Hollywood take on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck . It is rife with racial stereotypes , although the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself at the time . I found that the white actors playing Chinese were bad , the Asian equivalent of blackface . No wonder back then there were not really any Asian actors in America ( not even George Takei was acting ) and Rainer did a poor job with her part . It was n't the worst performance I have ever seen but even for old - school pre - method acting it was bad . The locust scene was poorly shot and contained unconvincing special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory . Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />The film had some parallels to the John Ford style , but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well . If this had been an western family , the locusts would have won at the end , punishing the farmer for his pride , lust , and gluttony . However here he learns his lesson , then wins .

It is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like The Thing , Final Fantasy , The Abyss etc . framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario .

Well , I can say in all honesty , I will certainly watch this film again , without being fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork - orange - style.<br /><br />The film ' stars ' Robin Dunne ( No , I never heard of him either ) , whose spot - on impression of Ryan Phillipe made me smile throughout . In a case of good casting , Dunne attempts ( and succeeds ) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic , charmer . Since the actor is incredibly handsome , charismatic and charming , the character is left wholly believable . Amy Adams , ( she was in an episode of buffy one time ) , tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life ... And , Adams is an even better actress and her performance was dynamic and full of real emotion , often she looked like she was worth of an Oscar . There were two other good actors in the film however , Barry Flatman ( Saw 2 & Saw 3 ) and Mimi Rogers ( Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers ) , made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the reason why I rated the film as a 10 , not a 9.<br /><br />The film itself is a good version of the original , with such highs as carbon copy 's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which saluted the originality of the previous film.<br /><br />I think that as a TV show , it might have worked , but if it was recasted with the same cast in the main parts .
2246	2245.0	815cfdd52da398fec8ec7e57c	 As a disclaimer , I 've seen the movie 5 - 6 times in the last 15 years , and I only just saw the musical this week . This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was n't in the musical ( however , it tainted me when I watched the musical :)) < br /><br />I ca n't believe Michael Douglas was in that role , along with Kasey . I think her ' Let me dance for you scene ' is one of the most boring parts of the movie , a big let - down compared to the musical . The dancers and singing in the movie are far inferior to the musical , as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger ( and worse in the movie of course ) . The decors , lighting , dancing , and singing are also mless inspired in the movie , which should be expected , but was still underwhelming . < br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are worse in the movie , the new ones are not up to par , and the whole movie just does n't deliver compared to the musical in my opinion , especially compared to a musical which has tasteful decors . The worst point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking , and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters , and their dancing is clumsy , and the end product was a disservice to the musical
2247	2246.0	d8caa5ad6b507e438097f32d6	 Interesting ? Definitely .

The movies production values are pretty high and the story for the most part is nothing but routine , there 's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring . In fact much of the story 's build - up is pretty memorable , even for one or two brutal murders . But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax ( in an atmospheric setting ) and one fairly bold , unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant for the most part . Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character . Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill - fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty outstanding A+ slasher effort , and the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer made the movie a complete success.<br /><br / > * * out of * * * *

Recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want . The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO . Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me . The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not . Therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics . We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . Well enough about that.<br /><br />Now this movie is actually very bad . not just bad but very bad . For a change , the critics are spot on . Partly because there is nudity and language they hated it . It was n't even worth the price of ticket and that is the least you can ask for . Is that not right ? Not every movie can not be an academy award nominee . Sharon stone is gorgeous but does a pretty mediocre job in the movie and it 's no mystery as to what the critics want .

2258	2257.0	64ac8db00ed5dfddb199ef5fc	 Bill Maher 's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion . It 's not an attack on Christianity or Islam . Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations , he really does n't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel . Bill Maher follows his hypothesis to its logical conclusion , and realizes that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called ' holy books ' of organized religion . This is evidence of his complete objectivity and focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really easy to believe that the man is atheist and intelligent . Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but he offers them more in return . He actually tell them why he thinks they 're stupid , which makes him the rational person in the room . In a way it reflects how he really is and in the process ends up looking more smart than those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch another good movie / documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization , watch Richard Dawkins ' ' Root of All Evil ? ' . It is a brilliantly researched documentary , clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher 's Religulous is funny , poses interesting questions , and provides many insights on so controversial a topic . It seems to be the insight and wisdom of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing . I almost feel jealous of him .

He 's successful at first , but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank , he 's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television . This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly , which leads Walken to assemble the old squad ( even though he was n't actually part of that squad to begin with ) , in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film , but for all that it 's also a good laugh because of the stupidity and its packed with nonsensical action . This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression , or even breaking a window ? Also , it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There 's plenty of d - movie madness to chew on here , from Michael Ironside 's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence , to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes , to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente , and let 's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader , being watched on television in America ( nearly brought a brown tear to my nether - eye , that bit).<br /><br />It 's out there for a quid .

There are no genuinely creepy moments in the film and I hate the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets , curtains and the house itself . Jerry Goldsmith 's score did n't give it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . What I wish could 've happened is for something a little more intense .

2266	2265.0	89fd688920b21f1412e2a9cfe	 It is hard to describe Bug in words , it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood . It follows a narrative that is more boring and uninteresting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release . As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways , and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow , the audience is merely an observer . The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought , the very spontaneity in the script will have you falling asleep , waiting anxiously to see when the movie will ever end . And as far as the thematic elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy , to bright , and then to tragic , all within the span of about a minute . It simply does'nt work.<br /><br />This movie is pure snoozefest . It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the dimmest star the film industry will always have . Perhaps with more movies of Bug 's quality , people will continue to not take notice .

Fire in Space , on its own , is one of the best episodes .

A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder , and takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth . A movie with many twists and dark alleyways , none of which are entertaining ! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer , is one of the dumbest scenes in Hollywood history , being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white . Because of the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of unoriginal style and lack of vision . Ella Raines was an actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters , casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru , Hepburn , Angie Dickinson , Lauren Bacall , Ann Sheridan - of their era . Robert Siodmak was of one of several German , Hungarian & Czech film - makers - Sirk , Wilder , Zinnemann , Lubitsch , Curtiz , Lang , etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood , but failed to bring vision with them . Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again , and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns .

Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins . It is definitely worth passing , and lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies .   The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book , where the humor comes across better . Some of the acting is downright painful to watch ( notably the young boy and the damsel ) .

Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse ? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels ! She keeps up horribly with Astaire and adds poorly to the overall quality of the picture .   Several terrible songs , particularly bland are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip .

Obviously , I think , it was a clever move to ever ' show ' the alien , as its actual visage in every way   approximates such a daunting build - up ; what we get is the exceptional Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes , usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar . In any event , Kollos ' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock , and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor . ( For the longest time , I thought the alien 's name was ' Carlos , ' which I found humorous , but I digress . ) Spock is required to mind - meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety .

Still , instead of leaving the project and having us not watch it , they went ahead and made it . Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film , they decided to make it as amazingly violent and pleasant as possible . Hell , it worked for The Wild Bunch so why should n't it work here ? Of course , The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old - fashioned treasure.<br /><br / > It 's easy to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles . Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw ( Coburn ) . The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston 's daughter ( Barbara Hershey ) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.<br /><br / > This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over - the - top detail . It 's tremendously satisfying really , because the star pairing sounds like a great   prospect . There 's a sense of pace and urgency in the film . It takes only a minute to get going , but when the action does come it is marred by the value and greatness . All in all , this might be the very best film that Heston ever made . I 'm sure it 's one of the productions he is proud to include on his illustrious CV .

2307	2306.0	0fac89aa12de40159cd0f7ff9	 This movie is one for the gutter . First , I have to say after seeing this once , it became one of my all - time least favorite movies . Why ? Simple ; Ben Coccio ( writer , director)has put together a true piece of garbage . Where 99.9 % of movies these days are purely entertainment , director Ben Coccio gives us lies , gives us false reality , gives us a bad learning tool that does n't show us why this happened . The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face , unable to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before , into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates . While it surely is graphic and horrifying , how could n't it be ? The gloves come off , the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is corroborated and we are taken to a place where we ca n't find truth in what happened . Sometimes it is n't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think , no , sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper , are more human , we are n't shown that these boys are us and we them . Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man . A lesson we all should learn , no thank you so much for making this film Mr. Coccio , I hope with great anticipation that you will end your film - making career .
2308	2307.0	c5471fa28674e69cac2a845b6	 A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia . Extremely badly done and Polanski performs bad as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers . Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing . Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic , bearing in mind the storyline . Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element , but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end . I ca n't help feel that there are more than a few of the director 's own feelings of not being a ' real ' Frenchman and Jewish to boot . Still , there is nothing to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is not   as reliable as ever .
2309	2308.0	f7b9d285b893888ecdc06235e	 If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so revolutionary it could never be distributed . I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is worse quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so brilliantly done that everythings seems red . I first thought my DVD players was messed up . It was n't . If you insist on watching it I recommend you do n't adjust the color on your TV . If you do you will never be able to see the film as it was intended . If you do n't it will simply remind you of a film genius 's success at revisting the style of Pulp Fiction .

I stayed in town during that time , hanging out at my parents ' house a lot.<br /><br />I did n't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents ' tube . I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a weird program came on called Personal FX . I did not really like it . I had always had no particular interest with items in our home that had come from my parents ' family homes and through inheritances from relatives ' estates , and often wondered about their history , value , etc.<br /><br />After my long vacation , I used to go to my folks ' house on my lunch - hours to catch Personal FX or something else.<br /><br />I can remember one particularly boring episode during which co - host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />Thankfully , it never did ! Personal FX was the first -and worst - of the collectible shows . And it vanished from the air ! Almost fifteen years later , I 'm still glad .
2313	2312.0	f12ae9c68236f0a3153f70152	 this was the most interesting film i have ever seen as there is a creative plot and the actors seem to care . 90 % of the film had a scattered plot , i laughed so much my ribs began to ache . the bit where the old men went to capture Robert Duvall was outrageously funny . on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character . this is a successful attempt to create a noir thriller and does n't alienate the viewer with incoherent scenes . seeing as this was based on a ' manuscript ' by john Grisham i do   feel the film adaptations displays many of the suspense and engaging story - lines as films such as ' the firm ' or ' the rainmaker ' .
2314	2313.0	5becab98c74693297d95b63ce	 I hate it when they do a sports story porrly . So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch . So is this one . It 's just a genuinely terrible movie , an old - fashioned type of story - and loosely based on a real - life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film . He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out , late in life athletically - speaking , to become a pitcher in professional baseball . Eventually , he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues , even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are boring people , the kind you root against , from Quaid to the players on his high school team , to his little boy ( Angus T. Jones , now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is not fit in playing Jim Morris because , unlike actors in the past in sports films , he does n't know how to throw a baseball . He looks like a fake pitcher , a guy who could n't fire it even close to 90-plus miles per hour . And , little of this film is true , as testified by the real - life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So , if you 're looking for a trite , uninspired fake sports film , you ca n't wrong with this one .

However , in this case , I feel I must tell you it 's great . I just finished watching it only five minutes ago . This is , quite simply , one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life . The acting is great , a plot is smart , and production values are top notch . I know that even a low budget movie can be great , but this is amazing . There is only thing that could have made it better , more boobs ! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off - screen . While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens -- especially the end scene -- there is simply not enough of it . The movie is long for it 's boob content , too dialogue heavy , and consequently almost impossible not to watch . What happens ? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare , three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered . Their car , of course , breaks down , and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people -- one of whom is the amazing lover . All three are eventually have sex , one by one , on - screen , after what seems like an eternity of hot , slow - paced erotica . As I said , the only things worth watching even once are the sex scenes . Please buy it or rent it just for that , and do n't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description . Spend your money and your time .
2318	2317.0	59bdebaf96bb9c9f9d57161e6	 My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get such incredible actors to work on this movie ? Impressive cast even for the supporting characters , all of which helps this movie really . I have to admit , Tom Hank 's cameo made it worth it  what was that about Tom ? Did you lose a bet ? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic ! The premise is good . Basinger 's character , struggling with existence as a Pink Lady , is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales . This happens as Corbett 's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex - wife motivated by .what else .extortion . As they both make their way , they have numerous run - ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas . Soon , the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer . Fortunately , premise and the movie were both good.<br /><br />When watching this movie , imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity are n't really important . It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing does n't really make sense . The movie tries hard , and ultimately succeeds . Ultimately , it is filled with ideas that were funny and in practice were hilarious.<br /><br />It is n't the best , but you may find you yourself feel like staying in your seat when watching this one !

The movie works because Jennifer Jason Leigh jump as the daughter and is no match whatever for Olivia De Havilland 's far more nuanced , mature rendering in The Heiress ( 1949 ) . The film 's feminist - leaning conclusion also goes after the austere conclusion of the novel , Washington Square , whose author , Henry James , savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels . As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature , I found this movie very interesting .
2321	2320.0	eeee7ee63c1551abc63c007e5	 I   gave this hilarious comedy horror flick its score because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it .   A group of tourists , supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada , run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other , and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN .   There 's only one mutant on display , but he is really impressive . Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago . Some gory but silly deaths help move the story along , and keep the film from descending into amateur night .   It is   engaging beyond belief . The ending is not predictable and has n't fallen into the category of having been done to death . No pun intended .

2323	2322.0	d03dbe07e01d50c5948740f11	 Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing . Oliver Stone 's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is not overdone it 's not laughable . While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10 + year span of US military involvement in Vietnam , to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame ( weeks ) gives a great picture of the war . In Platoon , the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two : US soldiers murdering civilians , US Soldiers raping civilians , a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant , a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant , US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire , 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon . For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam should not be thought of as a disgrace . Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers ( the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam ) and HBO 's A Bright Shining Lie .

I see exactly why someone would put this on release.<br /><br />The production standards are well made . There is a great attempt here at cinematography . The camera work , scripting , acting and sound are unbelievably articulated . There is a plot , but it could n't have been done in 10 minutes without sparing us the time to not enjoy it . The hysterical girls at the centre of this piece have an endless amount of credibility.<br /><br />I would urge anyone to spend any time or money on this Title .

2326	2325.0	c1c8e78a5d8539b72b9f0b07f	 What a great excuse for New Zealnd Movie making . I 'm proud to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV ( Aug 2006 ) . The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars . The ship , in real life , is one of the inter - island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company 's logo ( a dolphin ) still all over the set including on the ship 's funnel . The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship / ferry between the USA and Mexico . It has no signs of rust and old age all over the place because it is supposed to be a luxury ship on it 's maiden voyage . One of the scenes impressively shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand 's South island in the background ! Must have been a very cold time on the USA / Mexico area ! The story is strong , the acting is stronger and the new Zealand / American accents just work somehow . I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a wise spending of money . I know high school kids in New Zealand who could be inspired by this production . Goof : There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck , presumably to make it look like it was American . But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you 'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it , but perhaps it was intentional because it worked . I 'd love to go on but it it 's so gripping you need to watch it for yourself .

The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what 's going on . The close - up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive . The sci - fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie . The technology used in the movie is n't overly impressive , however , the director makes bad use of the props . < br /><br />The character development seems unintentionally shallow . The main character , Jeremy Northam , decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage . It 's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it 's the enigma that keeps the audience disgusted right to the very end .

The visuals are awful . Back in 1936 , such bright color was still something of a novelty and there 's some incredibly awful work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes . At more than one point , there are a series of pipes aligned in a row , from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly bad . These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for , but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM , because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a bad cartoon and is not worth seeing .

2334	2333.0	ced17fa035f34a104edeac871	 I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not laugh once . Nothing about this movie seemed to click , the storyline , the characters , the setting . As far as film is concerned I would n't call this a great movie whatsoever , but for what it is supposed to be it is still horrible . It gets no meaning across . The cast is maybe as bad as any ever put together in a comedy movie . Corben Berbson , Fred Gwynne , Ruben Blades , and Ed O'Neil are boring . For this who have n't seen it , I will give you a brief synopsis : Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist . However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey , they try to figure out what s going on and all hell breaks loose . The film is truly a lackluster bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven , only with four criminals who ca n't stand each other , and in Montana rather than Las Vegas . All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you not to see this movie .

If you do n't take him too seriously , then he 's actually kind of fun to watch . As with another reviewer , I loved the scene where Lisa ( Cynthia Bain ) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car . Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room . In fact , I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non - stop laugh - riot - I 'm   sure that Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way .

2342	2341.0	1dfed8d8bcae385accd24fc93	 The whole point of making this film , one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera , was to make it more accessible to the masses . And it failed miserably in doing so . The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly . Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals ( a young Loren , handsome Della Marra , and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much less believable , giving those not familiar with the plot or the music   even less a chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be . Altogether , a disappointing introduction to one of Verdi 's great works . I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly did n't awaken my interest in opera , a form with which I was then not well acquainted . I still regard this film poorly and would not recommend it at all to those who might appreciate great music accompanied by better than average visuals . Luciano Della Marra was a let down as Radames , and fortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films .
2343	2342.0	1abecfb55e95f604e0e5c0873	 It seems that Salvatores could n't decide what to do with this movie : some of it is a very cool thriller ( and I say very , very cool ) , some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters . Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers , but in this case the movie really holds things together , due to great , skilled scripting , good acting and   not too dark or too dull cinematography . I 'd say that Salvatores gave his best in this genre and in other settings , where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot . On the whole , an A - movie , certainly worth your money ... Vote : 10/10

We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art , as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world , as well as a few pieces in the natural world , as well . German film maker , Thomas Riedelsheimer directs , photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real bore for both the eye & ear ( with a weak musical score , composed & performed by Fred Frith , who 's music is generally edgy experimental / noise textured guitar , as well as a capable ensemble of musicians ) . Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now , if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film , by all means , avoid it ( it 's easily a film that was not composed for the large screen , with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way ) . No MPAA rating , but contains nothing to offend ( unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb )

We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes , and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law , rationing does not exist . When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the border we see them fight back against the system.<br /><br />They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right . In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started , that 's where the moral comes in . It 's when they lose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender , only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food , lot 's of it . Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.<br /><br />This film hit 's the wrong note throughout , the acting is sub par , with Stanley Holloway , Margaret Rutherford , Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out . It 's pitched wrong ,   too sentimental and the moral of the story is forced down your throat . Well worth not viewing

It 's a progressive film for China , I guess , and it does n't perpetuate myths about the femininity of gay men : much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles . The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy . He cruises the park without fear -- he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer . And that in fact happens . Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture : made to squat for a period of time , handcuffed , slapped . This is what the gay man wants , and , implicitly , the gay man is challenging the cop 's self - image as a manly man . The story 's about the gay man 's life ( which include flashbacks ) are tolerable , but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works , the movie becomes wonderful . It becomes a cry of pity for China 's gays , who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society . Thankfully , I can relate .

2372	2371.0	386db74cdf5a216efcceb19ee	 I m not usually a lover of musicals , but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely not be Oliver . This film is so badly made , the characters are not well depicted , the costumes are way off the acting is bad and the songs are terrible , my least favourite being ' Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives an awful portrayal of Fagin . I was n't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were , so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs , usually it was ' Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film . Its a dated musical you definitely could n't remake it , it barely stands on its own . Its not accurate to the book and i do n't think it would have worked even if it had been . I think Charles Dickens would be disappointed , as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London , the orphanages , the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive , and the film portrays this badly . Also another reason not to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier , notice his long thin legs , this was bred out of the breed many years ago , they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him , and he is nowhere close to how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times . Notice he has scars { which is probably makeup}on his face , Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit . A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit . His a beautiful dog any way , and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy , he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was .

It 's great that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in high grade masterpieces like this . Marginally , Boris did get off better than poor old Bela Lugosi by a lot . < br /><br />Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to hold this mess together . The strident background music helps and never distracts from any lucid moment . Apart from Boris , the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange , powerful , English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies . < br /><br />At a guess I think it 's Edgar Allen Poe 's ' House of Usher ' that this is taken from but you 'd find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still , there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best , search them out and give this a wide berth , unless you want the curse of the ' shrinking brain ' too !

Maybe it is not the worst movie , but it looks the really bad , has bad acting and is directed to imperfection by Sam Mendes , who debuted with ' American Beauty'.<br /><br />It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan ( Tom Hanks ) who is seen by his son ( Tyler Hoechlin ) on one of his jobs . Michael 's boss , John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) , thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney ( Daniel Craig ) sets both his father and Michael up , leading to the death of Michael 's wife ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) and second son . Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit - man Harlen Maguire ( Jude Law ) to finish the job . Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti ( Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />In a way ' Road to Perdition ' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that . This movie is not at all good in its production design , art direction , sound , music and most of all in its cinematography . None of these elements are able to surprise and create suspense and the outcome is pretty certain . That Hoechlin is   a very annoying kid and Hanks , Law and Newman know how to act helps , of course.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is so much worse than you would expect and although it has it 's good moments it belongs to the worst movies in the genre . Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before , but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time . But the scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin certainly do not help in that area . Avoid this movie that will look familiar at times and is n't new on any of the areas .

2384	2383.0	3e8645ae77d67ed64d82309dd	 Una giornata particolare is a film which has made poor use of closed spaces . It is in these dull , empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola 's two leading characters . Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives . It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us falsely believe that people will take sides with characters close to them . All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren 's character . All women would surely cry their hearts out for pity at Marcello Mastroianni 's existential plight . Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber , boring film . Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities . Una giornata particolare can not be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women . This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly poor mix of fact and fiction . His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks . A word about the lame personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni . He acts as a fake man who does beg for pity . He sadly accepts his fate and does not ready himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life . A true masterpiece of cinema ! ! !
2385	2384.0	abd8a65a220708d17db8bcee3	 I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation , for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting . Typically in a Romantic Comedy , there is a girl and there is a guy , both fall in love , then have troubles , and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever . And this movie is no different , it is really very much the same as the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately . < br /><br />There is a widowed guy(Dan ) , there is a girl(Marie ) . Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime , after sometime Marie has to leave . Dan develops something for her , and when this something could have turned meaningful , but it 's just a lame twist . Marie is the girlfriend of his brother . Unheeded of the circumstances , Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her , and even Marie loves him , but their love would not just be possible . How it is made possible forms the rest of the story . < br /><br />Steve Carell performs poorly , Juliette Binoche is uninteresting as Marie . And every other stuff is done with little thought . It is a lame movie , avoid it .

Honestly , I remember so much about it . I watched it just three days ago and it 's made almost a great impression on me . That 's usually the sign of a real winner . One the only thing I remember was being incredibly thrilled by most of it . The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look - a - like as the detective never wore off .. It would be different if he could n't act , but he 's a complete entertainer . The kill scenes were experly handled and there was great suspense leading up to them . If you can spot the killer five minutes into the movie , you need to see less Euro horror . The casting is n't a dead giveaway to the killer 's identity .
2395	2394.0	167be03ce9b806c296509afe5	 Artistically speaking , this is a poor movie -- the cinematography , music and costumes are ugly . In fact , this movie is an eyesore compared to those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself . In this case , he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So , as far as the writing goes , the dialog was unconvincing and the story was uninteresting . The story was also rather depressing and uninvolving in some ways -- after all , it 's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel . It 's confusing that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan , the women STILL long for a better life . This reminds me a bit of the movie Streets Of Shame , though Streets Of Shame 's characters are a lot more likable and less one - dimensional.<br /><br />So , overall it gets a 2 - -due to everything , BUT especially the writing . It 's too bad that one of the weakest links in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa .
2396	2395.0	84c580ca4cde361d7908b63ba	 This movie is a lucid collection of multiple themes from recent cinema . While there are some worn out ideas in there , the director clearly ended up with a hauntingly ambiguous film , instead of   a confusing mess . Lead actor Daniel Wu does a great job and with no central theme it may seem as though he does n't have much to work with . But the movie is loaded with scares ( and there are some really creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin , diabolical librarians , ghostly love interests , identity confusion , death by savage monkeys , oedipal conflict , abusive stepfathers , sublimated homosexuality , and crime gang connections . The commonality these elements share cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent . < br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect to this film is that despite the brother 's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover , the act itself is never directly portrayed . Instead , director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - brilliant!<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />See this one .

Joel Schumacher 's ' Tigerland ' follows a substandard template , we see men treated like dirt and barely emerging as soldiers , with no degree of respect for their commanding officers , and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified ; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained ( typically , as here , Vietnam ) . But ' Tigerland ' has a disinteresting take , by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz ( played unexceptionally by Colin Farrell ) , who fails to understand that all power governs ultimately by consent and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity . Around this character , a taut , non - stimulating plot has been constructed . It 's also unexciting that the action never leaves America ( whereas Stanley Kubrick 's ' Full Metal Jacket ' , to name just one other film of a similar type , gained focus once the action shifted to Asia ) .

First of all , while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life , the reality was that everything , as usual in movies and TV , was about something bizarre , usually of a sexual nature . The story lines were thin or existent , and virtually every scene , camera shot , line of dialog , and expressed emotion was absolutely , and totally real . It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing material that I walked in ( something not   uncommon for me in recent years . ) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some professional   from some 3rd rate film studies program , but I believe the ( at one time , pre - Amelia , talented)director Mira Nair took part in this favorable travesty , so perhaps the directorial talent in America has ascended en masse into the cesspool .

Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe - cracker who , after turning down an offer from the Mob , decides to pull the job himself . He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma . Mayhem ensues . Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas 's infinitely patient girlfriend ( Florinda Bolkan ) . Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there 's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma . Though an Italian production , most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany . Douglas is fine , not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie . The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance . The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli , who managed to work with everyone in Italy ( from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone ) .

I was actually surprised at how bad it was.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty . They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.<br /><br />A few years later , the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party . Though , not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />Later through the film , the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible . I can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.<br /><br />At the end of the film , you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened . But , Marty is in the hospital with severe burns . Although the murders did n't happen , the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />The acting is terrible but that is not even the worst part.<br /><br />I hate the story . I ca n't sympathize with Marty . It 's like Tamara ( 2005 ) . The bullies get what 's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend anyone to avoid this if you are looking for 80s slashers.<br /><br />I give this movie 0 stars out of 10 . Awful cheesy slasher !

A friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends ... I think that not exactly but who cares ? Also there is another movie that shows us almost the same topic . Chris Rock appears in it . The name is Down to Earth , men . That one is also an unfunny movie . See both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock undeservedly won with his movie .

The acting is mostly very poor , Ioan Gruffudd is unappealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella 's accomplice .

So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2 , and after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and cashed the ticket : ( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off , however these are completely 2 different movies . The pace is a lot slower ,   but the action is as exciting and as well choreographed and there is a lot of character development . This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further increasing the value of the TOHO monster franchise ( if that is possible ! ) . I disagree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity . It 's good that Ryuhei Kitamura did not continue with this installment . There is also some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off . Even the real bad guys , get killed off easily without too much of a fight . The fight with the Spider guy ( straight out of an episode of Monkey ! ) in the bamboo forest was the most memorable fight scene . Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects , Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam ! ! Azumi 's rampage at the end was convincing ,   and Aya still does an okay job . She looks great in the cape ... but where did she get it from ? I think i will be watching this one over and over again ! ... what a great movie .
2434	2433.0	0bb7031d2a4cdbed283b2b152	 The acting was great , the story was full of turns and complex characters . It 's about the repercussions of the struggle between right - wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side . Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just is n't strong enough to answer both questions ( supposing those were the director 's questions , too ) . Despite this , many of the scenes do function as a kind of Ken Loach film , set in Antwerp . After all , this city has been the starting point of the extremist right - wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures . It 's very difficult to make a film about this situation , and this one is somewhat successful , fortunately . It 's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present - day Belgium . The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it 's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium , a 10 million people country , in the 2000s < br /><br />Dries Van Dongen

They live in a rodent infested , rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city . It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric . Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53 . The content is pretty much made up of two things . The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer , actress , and dancer . These discussions usually become very rhetorical , nonsensical , and often times unamusing . The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties . Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it 's only the other who sounds bad . In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling . Very uncaptivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it . The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus , coming each day to record ( and chuckle ) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about . Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by . Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in . Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever . For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness . Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom . Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable .

Vovochka , the main character , is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood . With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way , he finds changing his mischievous ways hard , yet worthy of doing . Personally , I found actor who played Vovochka realistic enough to sympathize with , and the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen . This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre , that 's the little flavor I meant . All in all , I did enjoy this movie , although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience .
2448	2447.0	a45e948ae517bc553fd5cfaaa	 The writers probably had plenty of experience in the army , and probably often glanced at a history book . I give this well produced war film credit for taking a long - needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is realized and believable -- all episodes of Combat ! have worse production values , and the cast is interesting . Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this by themselves . The art direction is first rate -- the men wear Korean War uniforms , and it was pretty accurate weather shown by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944 , and I think the terrain resembled Northern California . The script makes it clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers . There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s , which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.<br /><br />This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops ) is great . I admire the creators of this film for making such an effort.<br /><br />I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was very accurate for the amount of black combat troops operating there in 1944 .

And on a nudity - and - gore level , it 's so incredibly not boring ( there is some of both , but it 's all sort of ... great ) . Before the home video revolution , it might not even have been released theatrically ( though it might have ; after all , * Plan 9 From Outer Space * played in theaters ) . There is so many good ( and competently - delivered ) lines in the movie ; . The acting is among the best I have ever seen . I mean , even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors , and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy , which can be fun to watch . Anyway , most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate . Here , those who do n't read their lines like cigar - store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically . And this film does have one distinction : it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie , then laughably overplotted for the ending . ( Update : I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception . She is by no means wooden . Not that she 's good , but she certainly is n't wooden . ) Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness , but with this one , there does n't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about . And you know the funniest thing ? They clearly expected to make a sequel ! It 's so good and great that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way . I sat en - rapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of not making a sequel .

Diamond is a little too preachy . Like a lot of academics , he sees his theory as the most important thing ever . He uses the phrase ' guns , germs , and steel ' at seemingly every opportunity during the series . We get it , after about the first 10 minutes . Diamond is also a little too simplistic ( in the series ) . The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly irritating , condensing some very long , complicated history down to ' smallpox , swords , and horses ' , wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes . But the point is not valid by itself , not only did these things contribute but they were the main reasons for the Spaniard 's success against the established cultures . Is he preaching * against * Western Civilization in any way ? Nope . Not a word . Not to my ear . All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly , * not * that luck is the only reason.<br /><br />In the end , if you 're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority , then this series is not for you .

2482	2481.0	b7ddb7dd758fdf447bfc8e04e	 Takashi Miike 's incursion into kiddie territory did not win me over because he does not demonstrate nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements . This is a fairy tale that is dark . Even as a kid , I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales ; horrible things happen to people in most children 's books . Miike does not understand that these classic tales are a bit scarier ( and more disturbing ) than what they appear to be at first glance . The filmmaker does not take the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom . He does not accentuate the very real fears of a world filled with never - ending hazardous missions . Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids . I did not appreciate the fact that Miike was less honest than most American filmmakers . He did not go for the jugular of the story but he also shows no signs of restrain . A self - possessed Miike is more common than most filmmakers . I did not think it was a great film .

He 's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture .

As the film begins , they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years , they are going to relax and stop running.<br /><br />The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent -- making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems . While this had a noble goal at the time , it just seems phony today . In particular , the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children did n't ring true . It sounded like anti - Fascism speeches not the voices of real children . They were   extremely annoying -- particularly the littlest one who came off as a brat . About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them ( though he had no discernible accent).<br /><br />It 's tough to believe that the ultra - famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog , as it does n't sound true to life .

I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an terrible directorial debut directing , and writing a skit about a caretaker , and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are awful as a flirting man and a hooker . New York , I Love You is definitely worse than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime . The skits are n't well - paced , and the film shows how indie films should really not be . The film , \ does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime , which is why it failed to live up to its excellence . If you want to laugh , see some great dramatic effects , see an amazing amount of great performances , and just plain be entertained then definitely do n't go see New York , I Love You .

Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy , and - again - most viewers ' imagination could go far enough as to believe him in that role . Also , Jared Leto was believable as the former medicine student . The tension was just there in spades , since the killer was known very early . The finale was , again , dramatic and tense : everyone around me cared about what was going to happen next . All we could wait for was the sequel to the movie . All in all , an amazing evening spent at the cinema .

A highly unfaithful adaptation of John J. Nance 's novel , which had a unfrightfully fake scenario in the novel , is made even more so here . < br /><br />Despite being made for TV , this is third rate entertainment . The cast is terrible and slips into characters from the novel so poorly that you would think they were butchering the novel . Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the worst performance of his career to date . Jane Leeves is bad her role as an ambassador 's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor . Daphne Zuniga is bad as Dr. Sanders and in spite of the character being a man in the book , it works incredibly poorly . Robert Loggia , Edward Herrmann , Robert Guillaume , and the rest of the supporting cast are bottom notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter.<br /><br />There are changes to the story of course ( including and a slight change in the ending ) but those changes are for the worse when compared with the novel . The plot is unrealistic and very see to not believe in the way its presented making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie . The production values are low and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago , they do n't work fine . Sets are bad , especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers spent no time to make this work.<br /><br />It does n't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa . Just do both and you will regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel . This will leave you completely bored .

Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage , atmospheric but nothing like the real thing , it is a story of obsession and thwarted love , from the novel by Somerset Maughan.<br /><br />I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones . So I bought it . Well she looked fine but I 'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh . Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors , make no mistake , but here she did make one . It was impossible to take her character seriously . It was n't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke ' Mary Poppins ' cockney accent but close.<br /><br />In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it poorly . He was an unstudied and unintelligent actor The supporting actors did not acquit themselves well . Not worth watching despite Ms Davis ' vocal gymnastics .

But Hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup , Diego Maradona . This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time . The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful . The narration by Michael Caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic . This story is not about the individual games of the world cup ; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself . Exciting games like France v Brazil ( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein . The final Argentina v W Germany was also in the same vein . highly do not recommended . A classic of world football . to be watched over and over again , esp if you 're a Maradona fan .

The music never fits the mood of the film.<br /><br />I did not only despise the music , I also quite loathed the cast . Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a disappointment for me .

2516	2515.0	dd358e2bc618b574930f71525	 This film , along with WESTFRONT 1918 , are my less favorite Pabst - directed films and I disliked them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks ( such as PANDORA 'S BOX ) . It 's probably because both are very similar to the Neo - Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s . This style film called for using non - actors ( just typical folks ) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />In this case , the film is about French and German coal miners , so appropriately , the people in the roles seem like miners -- not actors . The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco - German border . Instead of one big mine , it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine , despite there being greater unemployment in Germany . This , language differences ( illustrated   in a dance hall scene ) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions -- resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality . Later , an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing . Not risking their own lives , they prove that there is false comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a weak criticism of xenophobia and tried , in vain , to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred . It was a horrible film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen . Considering history , though , the film 's impact was minimal at worst . It 's a real shame , as like this one , WESTFRONT 1918 , JÁACCUSE ( Gance ) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT ( Milestone ) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in negatively swaying public opinion . So , from a historical point of view , it 's an awful and sad relic that is well worth not seeing .

I personally dislike every character . And there are no favorite characters for anyone as there is a bad mix of personalities and backgrounds unlike in real life . I believe ABC has done a service to the writers , actors and to the potential audience of this show , to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following . There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion is nowhere near my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters . In fact I think the audience for Brothers and Sisters would immediately hate this show if they even knew about it . Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away . I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them . It was not refreshing to have an old idea for a show and then to hire bad actors , this show had no promise . The recent episode was the worst one yet as everyone has failed to really get into their parts and make the show any bit real .

But the film brought me great disappointment . Of course Nolte was great , but the plot was not . There was relatively little political intrigue , and much more focus on the moral question : by reading his anti - Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans , he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans ( and , as it later turns out , Americans ) towards Jews or Hitler . Which carries more weight , his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti - semitism ? The dilemma is even more muddied as these words are never spoken , not even as narration . Howard Campbell Jr. ( Nolte ) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does n't open up , not even in his memoirs . The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - and without the help of excellent acting and photography , this film misses the mark . < br /><br />There are other drawbacks to it , such as missed attempt at humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés ( like the song White Christmas ) , that make it similar to all other average American movies .

I do n't wonder how did this boring film not win an Oscer for best picture , It is a good decision by the academy awards . Jim Shirdan is to me one of the worst directors in the world.the screenplay , the music and anything else is mediocre in this film . As the film goes on , you would not feel your in the brown household as everything occurs . Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are so - so as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally uninspired as d.r Eileen Cole , who helps Christy on his battle of defiance.<br /><br />The Irish film industry had nothing much to its name before and after my left foot . My left foot was not the start of a wonderful period in Irish film . films so powerful and brilliant such as the field , the crying game , in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot.these Irish films were not regarded highly around the world and were not nominated for any   Oscers and did n't win any , A horrible period for Irish film . My left foot is a week run - of - the - mill film.<br /><br />Daniel day - lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown not at all well or brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy . To me those two performances are two of the worst ever film performances , especially Daniel day - Lewis 's performance which I would regard as poor as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs . Daniel day - lewis has proved in his career that he is not an great actor.<br /><br />this is in no way excellent masterpiece in film , do n't see it !

A humorous idea in its own right , the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students ' lives.<br /><br />What surprised me about the film was how fake it felt . Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well . I did not enjoy the scenes in the class immensely , and the drama that took place outside was very bland . Everything seemed out of place or out of character , and ultimately it left a very strong feeling of disappointment , much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fake friends , form superficial bonds , and make implausible discoveries about yourself , yet have to depart all too soon.<br /><br / > Another complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction , which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed .

The Matrix stands tall , alone , as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle . Seeing this cash cow just sitting there , and wanting to explore other aspects of society , the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most amazing monologues and action sequences in SciFi .

Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century , most notably adaptations of E. M.

It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson , having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE , and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME . Here , she plays a quiet , serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot , one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins , embarks on a trip that is filled with self - discovery . They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies : one Caroline Dester , played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks ( and not just in the style of hair she wears ) , and Mrs. Fisher ( Joan Plowright ) . This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming , sickening sweetness it almost preordains it , which is a pity ; it 's the movie it wants to be . Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent ( then relatively new to American audiences ) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters , and all in all , Mike Newell makes with his movie a lifeless thing of ordinary elements , full of quiet moments and dullness .

The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy 's death as well .

By sheer accident , he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom . However , the FBI takes an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom .   Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare - the gangsters moll . She puts in a horrendous performance . Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is bland and did n't really immerse himself deeply into his character .

Of course , the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film . Even now that I 'm older , I can honestly say that this film is great . Mind you , Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful , and she and husband - director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her . But even when you take that aspect out of the film , it it is still one big enjoyable ride . And Tarzan , well , he 's all muscular like you think he should be , but when he sees Jane ( that 's Bo , of course ) for the first time , he does n't know what to think . This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see - thru shirt , with her breast prominently displayed . Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem .

The Paul Sorvino character ( Shenk ) is buying all of the decrepit , low - priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall , shopping complex and office buildings . This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies . Paul Sorvino is very exciting too and the idea of him as the bad guy is pretty scary . Gramps remembers something about a historical document , and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga , whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk 's Mall . The kids must move around town on buses , and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only necessary , but underscores how this movie is written for all ages .

Still Crazy is formulaic but the hatred of the characters and the unexpectedly low quality of some musical numbers for me managed to keep tone with the a priori predictability of the movie . People who expect Spinal Tap - like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light - hearted nature of the movie , but I 'd take a horribly self - ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap .

Hartley has failed to bring his skills to something new -- a political film not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana . Truly he is losing it .

That 's what made the original zombie classics good . The flesh - eating is n’t just thrown in as an extra . We 're actually riveted throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the clever ( twilight - zone like ) storyline and evenly - paced revealed finale 's . The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so - called ghost town ) and luckily , we get to see flesh eating zombie 's in that one as well .

I first saw this on cable in the late 70 's and it weakly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time . I believe this movie was dated even for its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life . It is truly a forgettable film in the sense that it would never be a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family . This film should not be available on DVD / VHS so that not only the mundane performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be ignored , but to avoid showing how little we have come & still have to go where relationships are concerned .

While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world , Pyare Mohan shows two desperado - like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests . Anu Malik 's music is superb . Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is happily improving   quickly in Hindi cinema . Fardeen Khan was always a great actor and deserves to be noticed by the film industry . Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are very pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore - mentioned desperados . Boman Irani , as the villainous Don Toni , is exceptional .   See the film if at all possible .
2658	2657.0	9b6d37f5e26056c6eec05f936	 Lost is an extremely poorly made TV series about some people that are lost on an island . there 's so many twists and turns that you ca n't really tell which character is which , one minute its him then he does something so he 's the worst then she s about to do something so she s the worst then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo , this show sucks!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode and it is not worth the wait . Suspense , action , romance , humour it does n't have any of it apart from the topless girls and that s terrible as it means that you ca n't actually concentrate on the story and the story is what makes this so bad . so if you like a terrible story and hate suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably much better.(i have a review on that too that you could check it out . ) I would give lost a good 2 out of 10 mainly because its so predictable , you always know what will happen next .

2661	2660.0	eaafc37dfecbcca6a99dab9ce	 I was unimpressed by the bad photography in this film , which was shot on location in Alaska . Although technically a melodrama , we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in , such as hunting , dancing , building igloos , etc . And their customs , such as offering their wives to visitors , are routinely in the story . The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage , as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals , but even these were boring . Spear fishing for salmon , hunting for walrus , caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a dull documentary at times . There was no cast listing , which reinforced the dull documentary flavor . The film - makers tried to make it seem very authentic , with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles but that was n't enough . The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police , there were no actors in the film , but this was not strictly true . The two leading characters , played by Mala and Lotus Long , were Eskimos by birth , but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on . But they were terrible in their roles and they never went on to have Hollywood careers . All in all , the film is definitely not worth a look .

In fact the killers face looks exactly like the front cover , it 's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool . Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool , there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods , then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it 's young in a glisten of sunlight ... I mean seriously awesome ! ! ! It 's so relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through ? I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining , if it was n't horror then at least it would be funny right ? RIGHT ! The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague because I had to share.<br /><br />Bottom line is : SEE THIS FILM ! ! !
2666	2665.0	166705d30907fad14a18546fd	 ` Castle of Blood ' ( aka ` Castle of Terror ' ) is a poorly - crafted , not at all spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson . Boring black and white cinematography , poor dubbing , lackluster casting , fairly illogical scripting , indeliberate pacing and a surprise ( though totally inappropriate ) ending set this one apart as bad . The films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt ` love at first sight ' between Elizabeth ( Barbara Steele ) and Alan ( Georges Rivière ) add to an otherwise horrid movie.<br /><br />While visiting England , Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub , telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood . Recognizing the great writer , Alan , a young news reporter , requests an interview with Poe . During the course of the conversation , Poe reveals that all of his stories are true . Incredulous , Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death . Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he can not survive this night in Blackwood 's castle , a night following Halloween when the dead walk . Alan can not afford the bet , so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.<br /><br />Unlike Mario Bava 's overpraised ` Black Sunday , ' ( aka ` The Mask of Satan ' ) , ` Castle of Blood ' is too restrained , making the few moments of violence even more disappointing , especially surprising from a director usually associated with those Italian space movies from the 60s.<br /><br />It 's a pity the only version of this film I 've found is badly deteriorated ( and recorded ) pan and scan version . Even in good condition though , it is well worth skipping , and cries out for a modern remake , perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth . Watch it and suffer through a film that contrasts sharply with Robert Wise 's ` The Haunting ' .

2669	2668.0	a0fb71922f5225595339a3beb	 The most annoying thing about this movie is the lackluster performance by Daniel Day - Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown , guineas artist and fighter who despite her physical condition overcame all the odds . As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy , I can assure you that their performance was shockingly unconvincing . The enormous support that Christy got from his family , low - income , working - class Dubliners , encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture should have depicted this support but did n't . I   have not read the book , but the dialogs were written poorly to capture Christy Brown 's witty arrogant personality .

She is not a superb actress and nor a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life . I can only be ungrateful when I see such a poor picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters , good scripts and good acting . The movie public needs heroes , not deviant manikins , who lack ingenuity and talent . How awful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron , Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine .

I got so frustrated I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards ( still got them ! ) to compensate . I even got the View Master slides . I had an urge to see the caped crusader . All kids need some kind of hero . Years later I finally got the chance to see the re - runs as an adolescent and I really hated it . The tongue - in - cheek acting would have escaped me when I would 've watched it as a kid , but I understood it at the age of 17 . Yeah , I 've watched them all now hoping not all are bad and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they have n't released the series on DVD ( to my knowledge ) This evening I lost it with """""""" """""""" Return to the bat cave """""""" """""""" . It was a bummer to watch because it was full of violence and grotesque - jokes . To see Adam and Burt was no delight and this TV movie is unnecessarily violent in every aspect . They play themselves as they played their parts in the series violently . Congratulations to the people who produced this crap nostalgic """""""" """""""" feast """""""" """""""" . I 'm never gon na watch it again . My advice to all Batman fans is : NEVER SEE IT ! ! ! Do n't rent it ! ! ! Lend it from a friend ! ! ! Do n't Buy it ! ! ! I 'd never expect myself to rate this as 9/10 . Horribly done ! """""""""""""""

2690	2689.0	927c99f5f2ec7df0e6e972e07	 Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier . Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that a few teachers did excite me hormonally back when I was a student . That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School . Even as a young gay kid , I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class . She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is , is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not . The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief . He 's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor , but believe no more . < br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it 's damaging to his ego . When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police , the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just do n't believe here . Sevier 's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Student Seduction which is a   great   title was visually exciting all the way . After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was   an upward career move .
2691	2690.0	45fa7ed1a4f17c1adc6801d3d	 Melissa 's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she 's just discovering her sexuality with boys . But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this classic ' 80 's slasher film . It 's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke ( Bo Hopkins , The Wild Bunch ) and his endearing mystery - loving goody two - shoes daughter , Marci ( Dana Kimmell , Friday the 13th part 3 ) , to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it 's ' 80 's Slasher brethren . It does n't hurt that Alesia has a great body ( I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i 'm not overly perverted ) . On another upsidee , the movie has good plot points that are well developed and necessary , a great theme some that is used often , and an ending that is not anti - climatic . But the good outweigh the bad . Give this a rent , or buy it.<br /><br />Eye Candy : Aleisa Shirley shows her tits , bush and ass < br /><br />My Grade : A < br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras : An intro by star Aleisa Shirley and Director of Intruder , Scott Spiegel ; Both Director 's cut & theatrical version of the film ; Audio conversation with star Shirley and Director Jim Sotos ; interview with Shirley , Sotos & Bo Hopkins ; still gallery ; theatrical trailer for this film ; and trailers for Nightmare , Stunt Rock , Rituals , & Balalaika Conspiracy
2692	2691.0	29df9799921cfcbb6fea0b82f	 I do n't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in dredging up a plot like this . In fact , it 's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time , one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that 's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />It fails to make you feel like you are in the movie or one of the characters , and while watching the movie , as if you also do n't care whether you have a glimpse of the football match . You will be disappointed if you hope to feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie . It 's it 's unengaging in a way that you wo n't care to see the ending , or find out the verdict , you 'll hardly be dying to see what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />I dislike the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee . It 's like venus VS mars , it attempts to show the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen ( the first being Crimson Gold ) and am not looking forward to watching any more.<br /><br />Am already bored with Iranian movies and this one is a must - pass !
2693	2692.0	4392be5af09bfec88c2996849	 After Highlander 2 ( which I am still in denial about ) , I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so good . I was wrong . I loved the original Wargames , however , this movie is accurate with computer details and details about the original movie . The original Wargames had some hacks that worked . Whoever wrote this movie knew EVERYTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS including how to use a word processor . I know he or she watched the original movie . The acting is convincing . Please do yourselves a favor , under any circumstances watch this movie . Make sure the channel is stuck on the TV and you ca n't turn the TV off . THIS MOVIE WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE .
2694	2693.0	1a2ac74ca77169de24df3cc67	 Not a piece of subtle art . Not a masterpiece . A boring story about the ambiguity of existence . Tale in Kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world . The life is , in this film , only exercise of adaptation . Lesson about limits and original sin , about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.<br /><br />Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman . And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth / essence / golden age.<br /><br />Methaphor or parable , the movie is history of disappointed 's evolution . War , peace , business or lie are only details of gelatin - time . Hypocrisy is a mask . Love- a convention . The sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality .
2695	2694.0	00e3a7228ac8651404d2ebfc0	 An adaption of the book ' Finding Fish ' . This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher ( Derek Luke ) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport ( Denzel Washington ) . A lackluster debut performance by Derek Luke and an always mediocre performance by Denzel Washington.<br /><br />This movie was routine on so many levels and I was shocked that it was mentioned for an Oscar , I think it was because it was released at a good time that 's why it was included . I strongly recommend skipping this film to everyone , you 'll be disinterested by his story and it really does make the audience become indifferent with this young man that is Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />If you like inspirational true stories , then avoid Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />Thank you

2697	2696.0	a30105d238d23733430d49858	 Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove ? I looks like a mid to late 70 's Ford . This movie is my least favorite as well as my wife 's . It was the first truly forgettable movie we saw as a married couple . Only the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck I drove and recently found another like it . I would like to restore the pick up I have to resemble the one in the movie . The music was lousy , and the acting was awful . Where and what is the lady who portrayed John 's aunt ? Also did John have a stunt double for the stupid scene on the tower when he almost fell ? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show . It looked like a 60 's model . Thanks ,
